Line managers have an impor-\ntant role in doing this. As pointed out by Purcell et al (2003) \u2018there is a need for HR policies to\nbe designed for and focused on front line managers\u2019. It is they who will be largely responsible\nfor policy implementation. Members of the HR function can give guidance, but it is line man-\nagers who are on the spot and have to make decisions about people. The role of HR is to com-\nmunicate and interpret the policies, convince line managers that they are necessary, and\nprovide training and support that will equip managers to implement them. As Purcell     et al\n(2003) emphasize, it is line managers who bring HR policies to life.",

The\n        Codes of Practice issued by relevant professional institutions, such as the CIPD,\n        should also be consulted.\n   4.  Assess any areas where new policies are needed or existing policies are\n        inadequate.\n   5.   Check with managers, preferably starting at the top, on their views about HR poli-\n        cies and where they think they could be improved.\n   6.   Seek the views of employees about the  HR policies, especially the extent to which\n        they are inherently fair and equitable and are implemented fairly and consistently.\n        Consider doing this through an attitude survey.\n   7.   Seek the views of union representatives.\n   8.  Analyse the information obtained in the \ufb01\n                                                rst seven steps and prepare draft\n        policies.\n   9.   Consult, discuss and agree policies with management and union representatives.\n   10.  Communicate the policies with guidance notes on their implementation as required\n        (although they should be as self-explanatory as possible). Supplement this com-\n        munication with training. 998   HR Policies, Procedures and Systems\nImplementing HR policies\nThe aim will be to implement policies fairly and consistently. Line managers have an impor-\ntant role in doing this. As pointed out by Purcell et al (2003) \u2018there is a need for HR policies to\nbe designed for and focused on front line managers\u2019. It is they who will be largely responsible\nfor policy implementation. Members of the HR function can give guidance, but it is line man-\nagers who are on the spot and have to make decisions about people. The role of HR is to com-\nmunicate and interpret the policies, convince line managers that they are necessary, and\nprovide training and support that will equip managers to implement them. As Purcell     et al\n(2003) emphasize, it is line managers who bring HR policies to life."

However,\nemployees may consume alcohol if they so choose under the following guidelines:\n        A.  Employees are expected to make travel arrangements at functions where they are representing the\n            Foundation and at which they are consuming alcohol, such as: assign a designated driver, take\n            alternate transportation, arrange to stay in a hotel\n        B.  An employee may be asked to stop consuming alcohol if it is believed they are exhibiting inappropriate\n            behaviour.\nAny employee found to be in violation of the preceding paragraph will be subject to disciplinary action which may\ninclude termination of employment.\n                                                                              Policies and Procedures Template - Page 28 SECTION 6\nHiring\nHiring Process\n    Being open and clear with candidates helps to set proper expectations, avoid disappointments, and\n    shape a positive candidate experience. By being transparent, your Foundation will not only have an\n    easier time recruiting top talent, you will also have higher rates of retention because expectations have\n    been clear from the beginning. Given that the Foundation benefits the community, it is important in the\n    hiring practices, to ensure that the workplace reflects their community and to authentically grow a\n    commitment to gender equity as an organization.\n    This policy provides guidelines that will help to mitigate risk in all aspects of the hiring process. Use\n    this as a guideline when developing your Foundation\u2019s process and amend to fit your practices."

The most significant benefit of the appraisal\n    system is that it provides a document of employee performance over a specific period of time, which is\n    a significant risk mitigant. The policy and procedure below is an example of a system conducted twice\n    a year. Considering the Deloitte process is something which the Foundation should undertake.\n    Regardless of whichever process is used, it\u2019s critical that there is a formalized process with\n    documentation in place. The policy below refers to a Performance Appraisal Form. There are many\n    such forms being used across the CFC network. Check with your CFC colleagues or the national office\n    for samples and amend to fit your appraisal process.\nPolicy and Procedure Statement\nAll staff of the Foundation shall receive performance reviews after six months and one year. In the second year of\nemployment, performance reviews for new employees will be conducted annually at the same time as other\nFoundation employees. The Chair of the Board of Directors evaluates the performance of the ED/CEO. Employees\u2019\nimmediate supervisor evaluates the performance of the employees whom they are supervising.\nProcedures:\n         1.  Support employees will be notified in writing at least two weeks prior to the date of the performance\n             review. A blank copy of the \u201cPerformance Appraisal\u201d form, with the exception of the \u201cGoals and\n             Objectives\u201d section, will be provided to the employee. Employees are asked to fill out the evaluation\n             based on how they would appraise themselves. The evaluation form needs to be completed and\n             returned to the Chief Executive Officer within one week.\n         2.  The employee\u2019s supervisor will complete the \u201cPerformance Appraisal\u201d form, with the exception of the\n             \u201cGoals and Objectives\u201d section prior to meeting with the employee.\n         3.  During the review, the supervisor and the employee will review the evaluation and an open discussion\n             will be encouraged. At this time, the employee and their supervisor will discuss and develop the \u201cGoals\n             and Objectives\u201d for the next year. This will be completed on the form provided.\n         4."

Although there is not a\n    way to make employee discipline completely pain free, implementing a progressive discipline policy\n    can help alleviate some of the discomfort.\n    A progressive discipline policy provides many benefits to employers and employees. Along with other\n    benefits, the policy provides structure and predictability to the discipline process, sets a basic set of\n    discipline standards for supervisors to follow, helps supervisors document disciplinary actions and can\n    be instrumental in defeating discrimination, unemployment, and other work-related claims.\n    The policy below is a best practice and it is advisable that your Foundation check with legal counsel to\n    ensure that risk is mitigated and that the process is fair and transparent.",
