Does the company\n                                intend to be a low-cost producer and to compete on the basis of price? Or does it\n                                plan to focus on quality and go after the high end of the market? Perhaps it wants\n                                to build a reputation for reliability. What if it intends to offer a wide range of\n                                products? To make things even more complicated, all these decisions involve trade-\n                                offs. Upholding a reputation for reliability isn\u2019t necessarily compatible with offering\n                                a wide range of products. Low cost doesn\u2019t normally go hand in hand with high\n                                quality.\n                                With these factors in mind, let\u2019s look at the specific types of decisions that have to\n                                be made in the production planning process. We\u2019ve divided these decisions into\n                                those dealing with production methods, site selection, facility layout, and\n                                components and materials management.\n                                Production-Method Decisions\n                                The first step in production planning is deciding which type of production process\n                                is best for making the goods that your company intends to manufacture. In\n                                reaching this decision, you should answer such questions as the following:\n                                          \u2022  How much input do I receive from a particular customer before\n                                             producing my goods?\n11.1 Operations Management in Manufacturing                                                                     552 Chapter 11 Operations Management in Manufacturing and Service Industries\n                                             \u2022  Am I making a one-of-a-kind good based solely on customer\n                                                specifications, or am I producing high-volume standardized goods to\n                                                be sold later?\n                                             \u2022  Do I offer customers the option of \u201ccustomizing\u201d an otherwise\n                                                standardized good to meet their specific needs?\n                                  One way to appreciate the nature of this decision is by comparing three basic types\n                                  of processes or methods: make-to-order, mass production, and mass customization. The\n                                  task of the operations manager is to work with other managers, particularly\n                                  marketers, to select the process that best serves the needs of the company\u2019s\n                                  customers.\n                                  Make-to-Order\n                                  At one time, most consumer goods, such as furniture and clothing, were made by\n                                  individuals practicing various crafts.

Perhaps the best-known mass customizer is Dell,\n                                which has achieved phenomenal success by allowing customers to configure their\n                                own personal computers. The Web has a lot to do with the growth of mass\n                                customization. Nike, for instance, now lets customers design their own athletic\n                                shoes on the firm\u2019s Web site.

Most people\n                                don\u2019t care about customized detergents or paper products. And while many of us\n                                like the idea of customized clothes from Levi\u2019s or Lands\u2019 End, we often aren\u2019t willing\n                                to pay the higher prices they command.\n                                Facilities Decisions\n                                After selecting the best production process, operations managers must then decide\n                                where the goods will be manufactured, how large the manufacturing facilities will\n                                be, and how those facilities will be laid out.\n4.

To meet the demands of these consumers, many\n                                companies have turned to an approach called mass customization4, which (as the\n                                term suggests) combines the advantages of customized products with those of mass\n                                production.\n                                This approach requires that a company interact with the customer to find out\n                                exactly what the customer wants and then manufacture the good, using efficient\n                                production methods to hold down costs. One efficient method is to mass-produce a\n                                product up to a certain cut-off point and then to customize it to satisfy different\n                                customers.\n                                The list of companies devoting at least a portion of their operations to mass\n                                customization is growing steadily. Perhaps the best-known mass customizer is Dell,\n                                which has achieved phenomenal success by allowing customers to configure their\n                                own personal computers. The Web has a lot to do with the growth of mass\n                                customization. Nike, for instance, now lets customers design their own athletic\n                                shoes on the firm\u2019s Web site. Procter & Gamble offers made-to-order, personal-care\n                                products, such as shampoos and fragrances, while Mars, Inc. can make M&M\u2019s in\n                                any color the customer wants (say, school colors).\n                                Naturally, mass customization doesn\u2019t work for all types of goods. Most people\n                                don\u2019t care about customized detergents or paper products. And while many of us\n                                like the idea of customized clothes from Levi\u2019s or Lands\u2019 End, we often aren\u2019t willing\n                                to pay the higher prices they command.\n                                Facilities Decisions\n                                After selecting the best production process, operations managers must then decide\n                                where the goods will be manufactured, how large the manufacturing facilities will\n                                be, and how those facilities will be laid out.\n4.

To estimate the number of\n                                    units that you\u2019re likely to sell over a given period, you have to understand the\n                                    industry that you\u2019re in and estimate your likely share of the market by reviewing\n                                    industry data and conducting other forms of research that we described earlier.\n                                    Once you\u2019ve forecasted the demand for your product, you can calculate the\n                                    capacity5 requirements of your production facility\u2014the maximum number of goods\n                                    that it can produce over a given time under normal working conditions. In turn,\n                                    having calculated your capacity requirements, you\u2019re ready to determine how much\n5. Maximum number of products       investment in plant and equipment you\u2019ll have to make, as well as the number of\n  that a facility can produce over  labor hours required for the plant to produce at capacity.\n  a given period under normal\n  working conditions.\n11.1 Operations Management in Manufacturing                                                                      555 Chapter 11 Operations Management in Manufacturing and Service Industries\n                                Like forecasting, capacity planning is difficult. Unfortunately, failing to balance\n                                capacity and projected demand can be seriously detrimental to your bottom line. If\n                                you set capacity too low (and so produce less than you should), you won\u2019t be able to\n                                meet demand, and you\u2019ll lose sales and customers. If you set capacity too high (and\n                                turn out more units than you should), you\u2019ll waste resources and inflate operating\n                                costs.\n                                                             K E Y T A K E A W A Y S\n                                    \u2022  The job of operations management is to oversee the process of\n                                       transforming resources into goods and services.\n                                    \u2022  The role of operations managers in the manufacturing sector includes\n                                       production planning, production control, and quality control.\n                                    \u2022  During production planning, managers determine how goods will be\n                                       produced (production process), where production will take place (site\n                                       selection), and how manufacturing facilities will be laid out (layout\n                                       planning)."

At the Vermont Teddy\n                                  Bear Company, for example, the cutting function is performed in one place, the\n                                  stuffing-and-sewing function in another place, and the dressing function in a third\n                                  place.

At the Vermont Teddy\n                                  Bear Company, for example, the cutting function is performed in one place, the\n                                  stuffing-and-sewing function in another place, and the dressing function in a third\n                                  place. If you\u2019re a cutter, you cut all day; if you\u2019re a sewer, you sew all day: that\u2019s\n                                  your function. The same is true for the production of Marshmallow Peeps at Just\n                                  Born: if your function is to decorate peeps, you stand on an assembly line and\n                                  decorate all day; if your function is packing, you pack all day.\n                                  Arranging work by function, however, isn\u2019t always efficient. Production lines can\n                                  back up, inventories can build up, workers can get bored with repetitive jobs, and\n                                  time can be wasted in transporting goods from one workstation to another.

Then, you\n                                  determine what ingredients you\u2019ll need to make the food. Next, you have to decide\n                                  when you\u2019ll need your ingredients. You don\u2019t want to make everything on the\n                                  afternoon of the dinner; some things\u2014like the lasagna and cookies\u2014can be made\n                                  ahead of time. Nor do you want to buy all your ingredients at the same time; in\n                                  particular, the salad ingredients would go bad if purchased too far in advance. Once\n14.

Explain how manufacturing companies use technology to produce and\n                                        deliver goods in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\n                                 PowerSki founder and CEO Bob Montgomery spent sixteen years designing the\n                                 Jetboard and bringing it to production. At one point, in his efforts to get the design\n                                 just right, he\u2019d constructed thirty different prototypes. Needless to say, this process\n                                 took a very long time, but even so, Montgomery thought that he could handle the\n                                 designing of the engine without the aid of a computer. Before long, however, he\n                                 realized that it was impossible to keep track of all the changes.\n                                 Computer-Aided Design\n                                 That\u2019s when Montgomery turned to computer technology for help and began using\n                                 a computer-aided design (CAD)21 software package to design not only the engine\n                                 but also the board itself and many of its components. The CAD program enabled\n                                 Montgomery and his team of engineers to test the product digitally and work out\n                                 design problems before moving to the prototype stage.\n                                 The sophisticated CAD software allowed Montgomery and his team to put their\n                                 design paper in a drawer and to start building both the board and the engine on a\n                                 computer screen."

BK can customize products because it builds sandwiches one at a time\n                                rather than batch-process them. Meat patties, for example, go from the grill to a\n                                steamer for holding until an order comes in. Then the patty is pulled from the\n                                steamer and requested condiments are added. Finally, the completed sandwich\n                                chutes to a counter worker, who gives it to the customer. In contrast, many of BK\u2019s\n                                competitors, including McDonald\u2019s, rely on a make-to-stock approach in which a\n                                number of sandwiches are made at the same time with the same condiments. If a\n                                customer wants, say, a hamburger without onions, he or she has to wait for a new\n                                batch of patties to be grilled.",

BK customers tended to be in a hurry, and\n                                more customers preferred the convenience of drive-through \u201cdining.\u201d\n                                David Sell (the same executive who had recommended letting customers fill their\n                                own drink cups) proposed to save space by wrapping Whoppers in paper instead of\n                                serving them in the cardboard boxes that took up too much space in the back room\n                                of every restaurant.

Now BK could locate profitably in\n                                airports, food courts, strip malls, center-city areas, and even schools.

                "text": "To continue growing, BK needed to change the way it found and developed its\n                                locations. Planners decided that they had to find ways to reduce the size of a typical\n                                BK restaurant. For one thing, they could reduce the number of seats, because the\n                                business at a typical outlet had shifted over time from 90 percent inside dining and\n                                10 percent drive-through to a 50-50 split. BK customers tended to be in a hurry, and\n                                more customers preferred the convenience of drive-through \u201cdining.\u201d\n                                David Sell (the same executive who had recommended letting customers fill their\n                                own drink cups) proposed to save space by wrapping Whoppers in paper instead of\n                                serving them in the cardboard boxes that took up too much space in the back room\n                                of every restaurant. So BK switched to a single paper wrapper with the label\n                                \u201cWhopper\u201d on one side and \u201cCheese Whopper\u201d on the other. To show which\n                                product was inside, employees just folded the wrapper in the right direction.\n                                Ultimately, BK replaced pallets piled high with boxes with a few boxes full of\n                                wrappers.\n                                Ideas like these helped BK trim the size of a restaurant from four thousand square\n                                feet to as little as one thousand. In turn, smaller facilities enabled the company to\n                                enter markets that were once cost prohibitive. Now BK could locate profitably in\n                                airports, food courts, strip malls, center-city areas, and even schools. The company\n                                even designed 10-foot-by-10-foot kiosks that could be transported to special events,\n                                stadiums, and concerts.\n11.6 Operations Management for Service Providers                                                                 578 Chapter 11 Operations Management in Manufacturing and Service Industries\n                                Capacity Planning\n                                Estimating capacity needs for a service business isn\u2019t the same thing as estimating\n                                those of a manufacturer.

The register keeps track of every sandwich, beverage,\n                                and side order sold by the hour, every hour of the day, every day of the week.

Each manager can adjust this forecast\n                                to account for other factors, such as current marketing promotions or a local\n                                sporting event that will increase customer traffic.\n                                Inventory Control\n                                Businesses that provide both goods and services, such as retail stores and auto-\n                                repair shops, have the same inventory-control problems as manufacturers: keeping\n                                levels too high costs money, while running out of inventory costs sales.

In service organizations, they focus on\n                                scheduling workers so that they\u2019re available to handle fluctuating customer demand.\n                                Each week, therefore, every BK store manager schedules employees to cover not\n                                only the peak periods of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but also the slower periods in\n                                between. If he or she staffs too many people, labor cost per sales dollar will be too\n                                high. If there aren\u2019t enough employees, customers have to wait in lines. Some get\n                                discouraged, and even leave, and many may never come back.\n                                Scheduling is made easier by information provided by a point-of-sale device built\n                                into every BK cash register. The register keeps track of every sandwich, beverage,\n                                and side order sold by the hour, every hour of the day, every day of the week. Thus,\n                                to determine how many people will be needed for next Thursday\u2019s lunch hour, the\n                                manager reviews last Thursday\u2019s data, using sales revenue and a specific BK formula\n                                to determine the appropriate staffing level. Each manager can adjust this forecast\n                                to account for other factors, such as current marketing promotions or a local\n                                sporting event that will increase customer traffic.\n                                Inventory Control\n                                Businesses that provide both goods and services, such as retail stores and auto-\n                                repair shops, have the same inventory-control problems as manufacturers: keeping\n                                levels too high costs money, while running out of inventory costs sales.

And tech workers aren\u2019t\n                                   alone: the jobs of accountants, analysts, bankers, medical technicians,\n                                   paralegals, insurance adjusters, and even customer-service representatives\n                                   have become candidates for overseas outsourcing.\n                                   Many U.S. workers are concerned about job security (though the likelihood\n                                   of a particular individual\u2019s losing a job to an overseas worker is still fairly\n                                   low). The issues are more complex than merely deciding where U.S.\n                                   employers should be mailing paychecks, and politicians, economists,\n                                   business executives, and the general public differ about the causes and\n                                   consequences of foreign outsourcing. Some people think it\u2019s a threat to\n                                   American quality of life, while others actually think that it\u2019s a good thing.\n                                   Spend some time researching trends in outsourcing. Formulate some\n                                   opinions, and then answer the following questions:\n                                    1.  About what percentage of U.S. jobs have left the country in the last five\n                                        years? What percentage will probably leave in the next five years?\n                                    2.  What kinds of jobs are being outsourced, and where are they going?\n                                        What kinds of jobs can\u2019t be outsourced?\n                                    3.  How does global outsourcing help U.S. businesses? How does it hinder\n                                        them?\n                                    4.  How has the trend in outsourcing manufacturing and service operations\n                                        to foreign countries helped average Americans? How has it harmed\n                                        them?\n                                    5.  Does overseas outsourcing help or hurt the U.S. economy? In what\n                                        ways?\n11.8 Cases and Problems                                                                                       594"

These actors include:\n\u2022  Shipowners: Parties that own ships and make decisions on how to use existing\n   ships to provide shipping services, when and how to buy new ships, and what\n   ships to buy.\n\u2022  Shipbuilders: Parties that build new ships and sell them to shipowners.\n\u2022  Scrap dealers: Parties that buy old ships from shipowners for scrapping.\n\u2022  Terminal operators: Parties that provide port services to ships, such as berthing\n   and cargo handling.\n\u2022  Intermodal transport operators: Parties that provide intermodal transport ser-\n   vices for the door-to-door movement of cargoes.\n   Other actors in the shipping business that are closely related to the shipping\nbusiness include:\n\u2022  Ship agents: Companies that represent owners of the vessels, and are engaged in\n   the routine business related to vessel arrival, operation, and departure of ships.\n\u2022  Charterers: Entities that employ ships to transport cargoes.\n\u2022  Shipbrokers: Specialist intermediaries between shipowners and ship charterers,\n   or between buyers and sellers of ships.\n\u2022  Common carriers:     Transport operators that provide services to the general\n   public at published rates.\n\u2022  Non-vessel-operating common carriers: Transport operators that have no oper-\n   ating vessels but coordinate the provision of shipping services. 4                                             1 International Trade and Shipping\n As shipping involves a number of business activities, the transport of goods by\nsea is important from an economics perspective for many countries."

These\nthree shipping companies increased their carrying capacity from 758,537 20 ft\nequivalent units (TEUs) (NYK 290,678 TEUs, MOL 246,895 TEUs, and K Lines\n220,964 TEUs) in 2004 to 1,028,632 TEUs (NYK 349,040 TEUs, MOL 366,871\nTEUs, and K Lines 312,721 TEUs) in 2008.\n   Seaborne trade has attained a growth rate of about 50% since 1990 (Morrison\nand Ward 2004). In 2004, it amounted to about six billion tons of goods annually,\naccounting for more than 90% of world trade by volume. This accelerating growth\nrate may be caused by China, which has become one of the world\u2019s biggest con-\nsumers of raw materials. Bulk trade has experienced booms on China\u2019s import\nside."
