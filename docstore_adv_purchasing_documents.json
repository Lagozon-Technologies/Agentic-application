P A R T       O N E\n       The Strategic\n       Contributions of\n       Purchasing and Supply\n  Purchasing and supply affects the strategic capabilities of the organi-\n  zation in many ways. Where in the past many viewed it as a standalone\n  function, it is now seen as a set of value-adding processes that link di-\n  rectly to the market and the organization\u2019s ability to innovate and deliver\n  value in the marketplace.\n       The new presence of major consulting \ufb01rms is one of the hallmarks\n  of the growth and evolution of the \ufb01eld. This stems from senior man-\n  agements who now recognize the importance of each expenditure and\n  related impacts and opportunities of purchasing and supply upon their\n  organizations. The major consulting \ufb01rms have the scale and breadth of\n  scope to develop insights on strategic and macro levels. The three chap-\n  ters in this section set the stage for the \ufb01eld fromthe top of the organi-\n  zation.\n      Chapter 1 presents concepts and viewpoints on the evolution of the\n  economy, \ufb01rms and organizations generally, and how purchasing and\n  supply \ufb01ts in themspeci\ufb01cally. Chapter 2 takes a closer look at how\n  purchasing can be a contributor within the organization. Chapter 3\n  bridges the conceptual future to the practicing present. It is the overview\n  of an extensive scan of the business environment and the senior levels\n  of purchasing with a reporting of how the \ufb01eld is expected to change\n  within the next \ufb01ve years.",

Where in the past many viewed it as a standalone\n  function, it is now seen as a set of value-adding processes that link di-\n  rectly to the market and the organization\u2019s ability to innovate and deliver\n  value in the marketplace.\n       The new presence of major consulting \ufb01rms is one of the hallmarks\n  of the growth and evolution of the \ufb01eld. This stems from senior man-\n  agements who now recognize the importance of each expenditure and\n  related impacts and opportunities of purchasing and supply upon their\n  organizations. The major consulting \ufb01rms have the scale and breadth of\n  scope to develop insights on strategic and macro levels. The three chap-\n  ters in this section set the stage for the \ufb01eld fromthe top of the organi-\n  zation.\n      Chapter 1 presents concepts and viewpoints on the evolution of the\n  economy, \ufb01rms and organizations generally, and how purchasing and\n  supply \ufb01ts in themspeci\ufb01cally. Chapter 2 takes a closer look at how\n  purchasing can be a contributor within the organization. Chapter 3\n  bridges the conceptual future to the practicing present. It is the overview\n  of an extensive scan of the business environment and the senior levels\n  of purchasing with a reporting of how the \ufb01eld is expected to change\n  within the next \ufb01ve years."

To minimize the risk of depending solely on one\ngeography,         procurement            managers         purchasing          agriculture        products\nshould adopt a strategy of selective global sourcing.

Indeed, language\nbarriers and improper business etiquette can be a major obstacle to es-\ntablishing a successful sourcing relationship. Seemingly innocent behav-\nior, such as showing the sole of your shoe to an Arab or rushing into\nbusiness conversations in Latin America, have caused countless business\ndeals to collapse. Cultural mishaps can undermine the ability to conduct\nbusiness and develop any trusting relationship.\n                    Industry Consolidation\nThe corporate motto for the 1990s seemed to be \u2018\u2018bigger is better.\u2019\u2019 Con-\nsider the following:\n     \u2666  Merger and acquisition activity across all sectors worldwide\n        totaled more than $1.8 trillion through the \ufb01rst nine months of\n        1998.\u2074\n     \u2666  51 of the largest 100 economies in the world were\n        corporations.\u2075\n     \u2666  The 300 largest corporations accounted for one quarter of the\n        world\u2019s productive assets.\u2076\n  Both \u2018\u2018buyers\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018sellers\u2019\u2019 in nearly every major sector have felt\nthe impact of consolidation."

Suppliers will deliver components\nand materials two to three times a week to achieve high inventory turn\nrates and maximize working capital ef\ufb01ciency. This example of supply\nchain synchronization is expected to improve 3M\u2019s new product concep-\ntualization and execution dramatically while lowering development cy-\ncle cost.\u00b2\u2070\n19.

Typical enhancements include\nimproving the quality and performance of the \ufb01nished good, enhancing\nthe attractiveness or features of the \ufb01nished good, and increasing the\nlevel of customer service support. From the volume-improvement side,\nsuppliers can be prime drivers of improvements in \ufb01ll rate (availability),\ncapacity, and manufacturing yield, for example. See Figure 1\u20136.\n      Although revenue enhancement is possible, it will require opera-\ntional changes: speci\ufb01cally, more extensive supply chain interaction with\nfunctional areas such as new product development and manufacturing\noperations. The level of interaction required extends beyond periodic\nmeetings to actual collaboration on the processes themselves over an\nextended period of time. In addition, traditional cost-modeling equations\nwill probably need re\ufb01ning to re\ufb02ect the new emphasis on revenue en-\nhancement.\nTHE FUTURE OF\n\u2018\u2018PROCUREMENT\u2014TECHNOLOGY\u2019\u2019\nNothing will shape, energize, and direct the future of procurement more\nthan the pervasive and profound impact of technology.

Some companies may opt to de-\nvelop an executive-level position that encompasses more than procure-\nment, something akin to a Chief Supply Chain Of\ufb01cer. This type of ex-\necutive would oversee procurement as well as other functional areas\nsuch as manufacturing, new product development, and distribution.

For the tactical procurement,\nthe organization will be small as technology further facilitates end-user\nordering of the high-volume, low-value items. In many cases, such tac-\ntical procurement may be outsourced, with low levels of effort and con-\ncentration on the part of the company to develop skills in this area. For\nthe more strategic commodities, the organizational structure will link\nsourcing decisions with the corporate and business unit strategic objec-\ntives through the CPO or equivalent position.\n      Organizational structures will vary depending upon the strategic\nprominence of procurement and the skills available.

However, in industries with low or nonstrategic\nprocurement (e.g., \ufb01nancial services), procurement will be used only to\ndrive cost reduction, without a development of the CPO position.\n      Another scenario is also possible. Some companies may opt to de-\nvelop an executive-level position that encompasses more than procure-\nment, something akin to a Chief Supply Chain Of\ufb01cer. This type of ex-\necutive would oversee procurement as well as other functional areas\nsuch as manufacturing, new product development, and distribution. As\ncompanies increasingly view the supply chain as a web of interdepend-\nent functions, having one individual charged with maintaining an inte-\ngrated view would make more sense than having only a series of func-\ntional heads.\n   The organization structure of the future will likely be split along\nstrategic versus tactical procurement, given the vastly different skill sets\nand business impacts of the two segments. For the tactical procurement,\nthe organization will be small as technology further facilitates end-user\nordering of the high-volume, low-value items. In many cases, such tac-\ntical procurement may be outsourced, with low levels of effort and con-\ncentration on the part of the company to develop skills in this area. For\nthe more strategic commodities, the organizational structure will link\nsourcing decisions with the corporate and business unit strategic objec-\ntives through the CPO or equivalent position.\n      Organizational structures will vary depending upon the strategic\nprominence of procurement and the skills available. However, despite\nthis variance, there will be common trends. For example, there is a gen-\neral consensus that a \u2018\u2018matrix kind of organizational approach and an\nincreasing use of cross-functional teams and cross-location teams\u2019\u2019\u00b3\u2074 will\nbecome the standard.

One reason is the need for\nlower costs. A majority of product development costs are locked in very\nearly in the product development cycle. In fact, for many companies,\nover 70% of costs for new product development have been committed\nto by the end of the concept and speci\ufb01cation/planning phases. By com-\nparison, only 30% of cost commitments occur during the latter prototype\ndevelopment and testing/launch phases. Unfortunately, the costs com-\nmitted to in the earlier phases are not expended until the latter devel-\nopment phases, when it is too expensive to signi\ufb01cantly alter product\ndesigns.\n            In addition to lowered costs, successful supplier integration during\nnew product development can yield other bene\ufb01ts, including reduced\ndevelopment time, improved quality of purchased materials, and better\naccess to and application of new technology. These integrated partner-\nships also bene\ufb01t suppliers by helping them make the right investment\nin people and technology to better support their customers. Accordingly,\nit is imperative to have cross-functional teams, including suppliers, in-\nvolved in the NPD process as early as possible. A recent study by the\nMichigan State University Global Procurement and Supply Chain Elec-\ntronic Benchmarking Network identi\ufb01ed supplier membership on the\nnew product development project team as the greatest difference be-\ntween most and least successful integration efforts.\u00b3\u2078 Companies like\n37.

One reason is the need for\nlower costs. A majority of product development costs are locked in very\nearly in the product development cycle. In fact, for many companies,\nover 70% of costs for new product development have been committed\nto by the end of the concept and speci\ufb01cation/planning phases. By com-\nparison, only 30% of cost commitments occur during the latter prototype\ndevelopment and testing/launch phases. Unfortunately, the costs com-\nmitted to in the earlier phases are not expended until the latter devel-\nopment phases, when it is too expensive to signi\ufb01cantly alter product\ndesigns.\n            In addition to lowered costs, successful supplier integration during\nnew product development can yield other bene\ufb01ts, including reduced\ndevelopment time, improved quality of purchased materials, and better\naccess to and application of new technology. These integrated partner-\nships also bene\ufb01t suppliers by helping them make the right investment\nin people and technology to better support their customers. Accordingly,\nit is imperative to have cross-functional teams, including suppliers, in-\nvolved in the NPD process as early as possible. A recent study by the\nMichigan State University Global Procurement and Supply Chain Elec-\ntronic Benchmarking Network identi\ufb01ed supplier membership on the\nnew product development project team as the greatest difference be-\ntween most and least successful integration efforts.\u00b3\u2078 Companies like\n37.

By simultaneously low-\nering its cost base and improving customer satisfaction ratings, the com-\npany has made its sales soar.\n         Once a company knows how it can use procurement excellence to\ngain strategic advantage and has determined how it will allocate re-\nsources across its portfolio of purchases, it then must make decisions\nabout the best ways to organize, conduct, and manage procurement. It\nmust decide, for example, how the procurement organization will \ufb01t\nwithin the corporate organization structure. Who will have responsibility\nfor sourcing, supplier development, and day-to-day purchasing? What\nprocesses will the company use for these activities? How will the com-\npany track results and drive performance? And what role should infor-\nmation technology play in procurement processes? Making and execut-\ning these decisions proactively  is the bridge  between    procurement\nstrategy and the other seven dimensions.\nPURCHASING AND SUPPLY ORGANIZATION:\nADAPTING FORM TO FIT FUNCTION\nMost leading companies have made major changes in their procurement\norganizations in the past decade, and many are not done yet (see Figure 42                   PART 1  The Strategic Contributions of Purchasing and Supply\n2\u20132).

A good illustration is a\nconsumer products leader that was grappling with two separate issues:\nIt was trying to remove the bottleneck in its production process to sustain\ngrowth in a highly pro\ufb01table product line, and it was reviewing its strat-\negy for sourcing a key raw material.\n       In a traditional approach, the company would address each issue\nseparately. For instance, the solution to the bottleneck might require a\nmajor capital investment in equipment, and the raw material solution\nmight entail searching for lower cost sources of supply.

                "text": "A U.S. consumer products company has set the standard for de-\nveloping suppliers where needed capabilities do not exist. When the\ncompany entered the European market, it found that local suppliers of\na key ingredient were priced much higher than in the United States.\nBecause the ingredient made up a substantial part of the cost of goods\nsold, the company, to retain growth, had to reduce the cost of this item\nor cut its margins. Looking at alternatives to buying the ingredient as a\n\ufb01nished product, the company examined the supplier\u2019s raw material\nprices and processing costs. It decided to reduce raw material prices by\ndeveloping its own supply market, purchasing raw materials directly\nfromlow-cost suppliers in Europe and thereby m\n                                              oving one level back in\nthe supply chain. To address processing costs, the company worked with\nconverters to implement U.S. manufacturing technologies that dramati-\ncally improved ef\ufb01ciencies and cut processing costs. Ultimately, the com-\npany was able to enter the market, meeting both its growth and pro\ufb01t\ntargets. 48                  PART 1 The Strategic Contributions of Purchasing and Supply\nDAY-TO-DAY PURCHASING: RUTHLESSLY\nATTACKING UNNECESSARY AND\nWASTEFUL ACTIVITIES\nAs companies enter the 21st century, A. T. Kearney estimates that 90%\nof normal procurement transactions will be eliminated and 99% of the\nremaining transactions will be completely automated. Non-value-adding\ntransactional activities will disappear, while necessary transactional ac-\ntivities will be transparently integrated into other processes of the busi-\nness.\n     Procurement leaders:\n     \u2666  Automate or elimate day-to-day activities or delegate them to\n        users or suppliers\n     \u2666  Cut waste fromroutine transactions\n     \u2666  Redeploy procurement people onto high-value-added activities\n        Leading companies began long ago to whittle down their supply\nbases to just a few key suppliers. Today they are going a step further,\narranging for their suppliers to take on many of their day-to-day trans-\nactions. Many have initiated programs such as continuous replenishment\nand  supplier-managed  inventory."

Leaders have erased the stereotypical view\nof the old-line purchasing agent by acquiring, developing, and nurturing\na new breed of procurement professionals with educational backgrounds,\nskill sets, and broad perspectives that equal those of peers in other or-\nganizational units.\n     Procurement leaders:\n     \u2666  Recruit and attract talented people for the procurement\n        organization froma variety of sources, both internal and\n        external\n     \u2666  Invest heavily in developing procurement capabilities and\n        skills both inside the \u2018\u2018formal\u2019\u2019 procurement organization and\n        throughout the network\n     Several of the companies surveyed recruit directly for undergrad-\nuate and graduate degree positions in procurement management."

Lean supply chains will become a competitive\n        advantage. \u2018\u2018Supplier selection is the most important thing that\n        we do,\u2019\u2019 emphasizes IBM\u2019s Richter. \u2018\u2018Our emphasis is not\n        necessarily on who is the best today, but who will be the best\n        two to four years from now. This may mean that we\n        occasionally compromise on some needs with suppliers who\n        are currently struggling but who we believe will be world\n        leaders in the future. Fortunately, though, this trade-off is\n        rare.\u2019\u2019\n     \u2666  Contribution. Supply chain participants will continue to rely on\n       each other more and share more and more resources with each\n       other to maximize value-added contributions and reduce\n       duplication of resources. For example, partners will participate\n       in joint planning, and dominant supply partners will\n       increasingly in\ufb02uence projects at the design and development\n       stages. \u2018\u2018In terms of supply chain partner selection and\n       contribution, the \ufb01rst thing we do is decide whomwe should\n       be working with and why,\u2019\u2019 states UTC\u2019s Farney. \u2018\u2018The next\n       step is to develop relationships with those suppliers. Here, we\n       begin to set mutual goals and track each other\u2019s commitments\n       and performance against those commitments, the result of\n       which is trust. It is really important to work together and\n       prove our worth to each other.\u2019\u2019 The third step is partnership\n       and true supplier integration.\n     To accomplish supply partner chain goals, many organizations will\ncreate strategic purchasing competency centers with highly trained per-\nsonnel who study their supply chains and identify opportunities to\nachieve competitive advantage via their:\n     \u2666  Choices of supply chain partners\n     \u2666  Determination of core competencies 66                   PART 1  The Strategic Contributions of Purchasing and Supply\n     \u2666  In\ufb02uence of design, manufacturing, operations, and sourcing\u2075\nTREND #5: TACTICAL PURCHASING\nThe future holds signi\ufb01cant changes for tactical procurement activities\nand how they are handled. \u2018\u2018There will, however, always be a place for\ntactical purchasing,\u2019\u2019 states IBM\u2019s Richter."

Once again, Fig-\nures 4\u20135 and 4\u20136 provide examples of a few speci\ufb01c supply strategies.\nA further discussion of the supply management strategy development\nprocess follows.\n     Many of the speci\ufb01c supply management strategies for      tactical\nitems/services call for increased involvement of suppliers both onsite\nand offsite. While these items/services account for a small percentage of\npurchasing dollar expenditures, these items/services frequently account\nfor the vast majority of purchasing transactions and the resulting ad-\nministrative costs of managing the acquisition process. The issue that\ndrives all supply management strategies in this quadrant is minimizing\nthe number of transactions and thereby lowering the resulting adminis-\ntrative cost of acquisition. With acquisition cost per transaction approach-\ning $200 for the typical order, acquisition cost can be 50% or more of the\ntotal order cost. The main supply management strategy is to minimize\nthe number of separate transactions through the consolidation of large\nnumbers of orders with fewer suppliers through the use of blanket orders\nand other supply base rationalization and order reduction strategies. The\nuse of procurement cards (P-Cards) is a frequently implemented and\nrewarding strategy.

                "text": "Segmentation Quadrant Strategies\nThe supply segmentation approach assists in the development of realistic\nfunctional-level, namely supply management, strategies. Once again, Fig-\nures 4\u20135 and 4\u20136 provide examples of a few speci\ufb01c supply strategies.\nA further discussion of the supply management strategy development\nprocess follows.\n     Many of the speci\ufb01c supply management strategies for      tactical\nitems/services call for increased involvement of suppliers both onsite\nand offsite. While these items/services account for a small percentage of\npurchasing dollar expenditures, these items/services frequently account\nfor the vast majority of purchasing transactions and the resulting ad-\nministrative costs of managing the acquisition process. The issue that\ndrives all supply management strategies in this quadrant is minimizing\nthe number of transactions and thereby lowering the resulting adminis-\ntrative cost of acquisition. With acquisition cost per transaction approach-\ning $200 for the typical order, acquisition cost can be 50% or more of the\ntotal order cost. The main supply management strategy is to minimize\nthe number of separate transactions through the consolidation of large\nnumbers of orders with fewer suppliers through the use of blanket orders\nand other supply base rationalization and order reduction strategies. The\nuse of procurement cards (P-Cards) is a frequently implemented and\nrewarding strategy. With P-Cards, users can order directly fromsuppliers\nby telephone to a certain dollar authorization level speci\ufb01c to each \ufb01rm.\nThis dramatically reduces transaction levels since orders are summarized\non the card\u2019s monthly statement and a single monthly payment is made\nto a \ufb01nancial institution instead of directly to numerous suppliers.

Environmental restrictions on emissions from certain\n          industries, limits on mining and forestry, increased costs due\n          to more comprehensive recordkeeping.\n      2.  Changes in import tariffs and non-duty barriers to imports,\n          including new standards or prohibitions of certain goods from\n          certain countries. Prior attempts to place quotas on steel is but\n          one example, with the result being to curtail foreign purchases\n          in favor of potentially more costly domestic ones.

Environmental restrictions on emissions from certain\n          industries, limits on mining and forestry, increased costs due\n          to more comprehensive recordkeeping.\n      2.  Changes in import tariffs and non-duty barriers to imports,\n          including new standards or prohibitions of certain goods from\n          certain countries. Prior attempts to place quotas on steel is but\n          one example, with the result being to curtail foreign purchases\n          in favor of potentially more costly domestic ones. More far-\n          reaching initiatives may derive from the increasing trend of\n          nations joining trading blocs.

Once such a scenario is created, developing recommended\ncourses of action becomes an imperative, but the problem is in seeing\nfar enough into the future that (1) one has time to act on the situation,\nand (2) there is suf\ufb01cient con\ufb01dence that the indicators are pointing to\npotential opportunities or threats. Too short a time horizon means that\none will only be reactive.\n                 An intermediate step that some leading companies employ is de-\nvelopment of key supplier and market pro\ufb01les. Typically, the information\ncontained in one of these periodic documents attempts to summarize the\nfollowing:\n     \u2666  Ownership and equity interests. Essentially, this is a \u2018\u2018who owns\n        whom\u2019\u2019 situation.

Rather, it is necessary and vital for the ef\ufb01cient and effective\nmanagement of the \ufb02ow of the goods and services that is so vital to the 126                   PART 2  The Strategic Approaches of Purchasing and Supply\nongoing conduct of business. To undertake any aspect of the purchasing\nactivities or attempt to employ any of the recently developed supplier-\ndependent initiatives\u2014be it manufacturing resource planning, Just-in-\nTime, integrated supply, or value analysis\u2014without detailed supply\nmarket knowledge only serves to increase the probability of failure. C H A P T E R           6\n      Purchasing as\n      Relationship Management\n      Editor\n      Steve Kesinger, C.P.M., A.P.P.\n      President of The Kesinger Group\n It is critical to understand where we have traditionally been in the past\n to appreciate where we are headed and need to be into the future. Re-\n lationship management in many organizations has been functional, with\n some communication between other functional staff, some communica-\n tion with internal customers, and a \u2018\u2018\ufb01lter\u2019\u2019 role with primary suppliers.\n       Purchasing staff were expected to have competency in the \u2018\u2018hard\n skill\u2019\u2019 areas, such as negotiating, understanding terms and conditions,\n conducting bid analysis, developing requests for proposal, and the like.\n These individuals were not evaluated based upon their management of\n the key relationships in the supply chain, nor were they provided incen-\n tive for that. In fact, by \u2018\u2018hoarding\u2019\u2019 information and playing the com-\n munication linkage role between internal users and suppliers, they were\n justifying their existence. In reality, these practices caused miscommun-\n ication, delayed communication, and frustration between all parties.\n While everyone\u2019s intentions were sound, in many cases they lacked the\n expertise to speak for engineering, maintenance, and operations.",

To undertake any aspect of the purchasing\nactivities or attempt to employ any of the recently developed supplier-\ndependent initiatives\u2014be it manufacturing resource planning, Just-in-\nTime, integrated supply, or value analysis\u2014without detailed supply\nmarket knowledge only serves to increase the probability of failure.

Re-\n lationship management in many organizations has been functional, with\n some communication between other functional staff, some communica-\n tion with internal customers, and a \u2018\u2018\ufb01lter\u2019\u2019 role with primary suppliers.\n       Purchasing staff were expected to have competency in the \u2018\u2018hard\n skill\u2019\u2019 areas, such as negotiating, understanding terms and conditions,\n conducting bid analysis, developing requests for proposal, and the like.\n These individuals were not evaluated based upon their management of\n the key relationships in the supply chain, nor were they provided incen-\n tive for that. In fact, by \u2018\u2018hoarding\u2019\u2019 information and playing the com-\n munication linkage role between internal users and suppliers, they were\n justifying their existence. In reality, these practices caused miscommun-\n ication, delayed communication, and frustration between all parties.\n While everyone\u2019s intentions were sound, in many cases they lacked the\n expertise to speak for engineering, maintenance, and operations."

This initiative, begun with a trial between Wal-Mart and\nWarner-Lambert, includes the sharing of product demand forecast be-\ntween a \ufb01rmand its supplier. In the Wal-Mart exam\n                                                 ple, it supplied War-\nner-Lambert with its projected sales of Listerine at its Wal-Mart stores.\nOver  time, these  projections were  so effective that Warner-Lambert\nachieved signi\ufb01cant improvements in shelf availability as well as re-\nduced \ufb01nished goods inventory. These improvements increased the prof-\nitability of both \ufb01rms. These types of initiatives require more than tra-\nditional  interorganizational   relationships.  True    supply    chain\nrelationships have grown froma transaction to a partnership focus. In a\npartnership environment, all \ufb01rms share in each other\u2019s successes and\nfailures. Because of this interorganizational reliance, communication and\ncooperation are required for the success of SCM.\n     Supply chains will differ depending on the industry. Some are more\nfocused on outbound moves (e.g., to customer), some on inbound (e.g.,\nto manufacturing), and others on a balance \ufb02ow (e.g., wholesaler). Figure\n7\u20132 is an example of a supply chain for automotive parts.\u2077 This supply\nchain is predominantly focused on inbound moves to both the automo-\nbile manufacturing plant (original parts) and the replacement parts dis-\ntribution center.

This rad-\nical change in viewing cost requires a tremendous amount of sharing\namong \ufb01rms in a supply chain. Firms must be willing to share infor-\nmation, risk, and planning to achieve true supply chain excellence. An\nexample of this is Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenish-\nment (CPFR). This initiative, begun with a trial between Wal-Mart and\nWarner-Lambert, includes the sharing of product demand forecast be-\ntween a \ufb01rmand its supplier. In the Wal-Mart exam\n                                                 ple, it supplied War-\nner-Lambert with its projected sales of Listerine at its Wal-Mart stores.\nOver  time, these  projections were  so effective that Warner-Lambert\nachieved signi\ufb01cant improvements in shelf availability as well as re-\nduced \ufb01nished goods inventory. These improvements increased the prof-\nitability of both \ufb01rms. These types of initiatives require more than tra-\nditional  interorganizational   relationships.  True    supply    chain\nrelationships have grown froma transaction to a partnership focus. In a\npartnership environment, all \ufb01rms share in each other\u2019s successes and\nfailures. Because of this interorganizational reliance, communication and\ncooperation are required for the success of SCM.\n     Supply chains will differ depending on the industry. Some are more\nfocused on outbound moves (e.g., to customer), some on inbound (e.g.,\nto manufacturing), and others on a balance \ufb02ow (e.g., wholesaler). Figure\n7\u20132 is an example of a supply chain for automotive parts.\u2077 This supply\nchain is predominantly focused on inbound moves to both the automo-\nbile manufacturing plant (original parts) and the replacement parts dis-\ntribution center.

Probably the\nmost important service elements in the supply chain are cycle time and\nits reliability. This is true whether it is cycle time through a warehouse,\nmanufacturing cycle time, transportation cycle time, or order processing\ncycle. Some \ufb01rms try to manage certain aspects of cycle times at the\nexpense of others. For example, a customer requires delivery of a product\nin seven days fromorder placem\n                                ent. The supplier needs one day each\nfor order processing, raw material acquisition, inbound transportation,\nmanufacturing, transportation to a warehouse, storage/processing in the\nwarehouse, and transportation to the customer. If manufacturing decides\nto increase its cycle time to two days, either the customer will receive\nthe shipment late or another area of the supplier\u2019s total process will need\nto decrease its cycle time, presumably at a higher cost. Cycle time service,\nas was the case for costs, is in\ufb02uenced by decisions in transportation,\nfacilities, inventories, and information systems.",

Probably the\nmost important service elements in the supply chain are cycle time and\nits reliability. This is true whether it is cycle time through a warehouse,\nmanufacturing cycle time, transportation cycle time, or order processing\ncycle. Some \ufb01rms try to manage certain aspects of cycle times at the\nexpense of others. For example, a customer requires delivery of a product\nin seven days fromorder placem\n                                ent. The supplier needs one day each\nfor order processing, raw material acquisition, inbound transportation,\nmanufacturing, transportation to a warehouse, storage/processing in the\nwarehouse, and transportation to the customer. If manufacturing decides\nto increase its cycle time to two days, either the customer will receive\nthe shipment late or another area of the supplier\u2019s total process will need\nto decrease its cycle time, presumably at a higher cost. Cycle time service,\nas was the case for costs, is in\ufb02uenced by decisions in transportation,\nfacilities, inventories, and information systems."

This process is consistent with\n13. M. Porter, Competitive Strategy, The Free Press, New York, 1980. 172                   PART 2  The Strategic Approaches of Purchasing and Supply\nSpekman\u2019s four sequential steps in the alliance-building process: strategy\ndevelopment, partner assessment, contract negotiation, and control/im-\nplementation.\u00b9\u2074 Most organizations have few strategic alliances and part-\nnerships in place simply because the process of executing and managing\nthese agreements is quite extensive.\n    Step 1: Establish Strategic Business Needs\nIt makes little sense to establish an alliance or partnership before deter-\nmining if this approach satis\ufb01es business needs. The purpose of strategic\nalliances and partnerships is to create competitive advantages where less\nis available fromtraditional sourcing approaches. Alliances and partner-\nships must align directly with business needs, whether these are corpo-\nrate or business-level needs.\n                Lower-level or basic alliances and partnerships often emphasize\ncost reduction as their primary focus. Alliances and partnerships, how-\never, can also emphasize quality improvement, cycle time reduction,\ntechnology development, and product and process development sup-\nport. The key point is that many alliances and partnerships should be\nhigher-level agreements that link directly to what the business, rather\nthan purchasing, must do to be successful.\n             Step 2: Create the Infrastructure to Support\n                 Alliance and Partnership Development\nWhile it is possible to develop lower-level alliances and partnerships on\nan as-needed or ad hoc basis, strategic agreements require a support\nstructure to oversee the process. Leading-edge \ufb01rms often use cross-\nfunctional teams to carry out the detailed planning and execution of\ncollaborative agreements. The logic of using cross-functional teams dur-\ning alliance or partnership development is straightforward. Since stra-\ntegic alliances and partnerships have an organizational rather than func-\ntional scope, it makes sense to have members from throughout the\norganization be part of the process. Not only does this bring together\ngreater knowledge and skill, it also helps promote buy-in to the process.\nOf course, using a cross-functional teamis no guarantee of success.\n14.",

Porter, Competitive Strategy, The Free Press, New York, 1980. 172                   PART 2  The Strategic Approaches of Purchasing and Supply\nSpekman\u2019s four sequential steps in the alliance-building process: strategy\ndevelopment, partner assessment, contract negotiation, and control/im-\nplementation.\u00b9\u2074 Most organizations have few strategic alliances and part-\nnerships in place simply because the process of executing and managing\nthese agreements is quite extensive.\n    Step 1: Establish Strategic Business Needs\nIt makes little sense to establish an alliance or partnership before deter-\nmining if this approach satis\ufb01es business needs. The purpose of strategic\nalliances and partnerships is to create competitive advantages where less\nis available fromtraditional sourcing approaches. Alliances and partner-\nships must align directly with business needs, whether these are corpo-\nrate or business-level needs.\n                Lower-level or basic alliances and partnerships often emphasize\ncost reduction as their primary focus. Alliances and partnerships, how-\never, can also emphasize quality improvement, cycle time reduction,\ntechnology development, and product and process development sup-\nport. The key point is that many alliances and partnerships should be\nhigher-level agreements that link directly to what the business, rather\nthan purchasing, must do to be successful.\n             Step 2: Create the Infrastructure to Support\n                 Alliance and Partnership Development\nWhile it is possible to develop lower-level alliances and partnerships on\nan as-needed or ad hoc basis, strategic agreements require a support\nstructure to oversee the process. Leading-edge \ufb01rms often use cross-\nfunctional teams to carry out the detailed planning and execution of\ncollaborative agreements. The logic of using cross-functional teams dur-\ning alliance or partnership development is straightforward. Since stra-\ntegic alliances and partnerships have an organizational rather than func-\ntional scope, it makes sense to have members from throughout the\norganization be part of the process. Not only does this bring together\ngreater knowledge and skill, it also helps promote buy-in to the process.\nOf course, using a cross-functional teamis no guarantee of success.\n14."

A purchaser may have a longstanding relationship with\na supplier, and it may become evident that elevating the relationship to\none that formally endorses collaborative efforts makes sense.

Indeed, an executive manager of one\ncompany may discuss with an executive manager of another company\nthe possibility of pursuing a collaborative relationship. If executive man-\nagement feels comfortable with this idea, then the process may proceed\nto the next level of development. At this point executive managers usu-\nally assign ownership and responsibility for further discussion to an in-\ndividual or group elsewhere in the organization. Detailed planning and\nnegotiation between the parties rarely happens at the highest organiza-\ntional levels (see Step 7). However, executive managers often demon-\nstrate their commitment to the process by signing the documents gov-\nerning the alliance or partnership.\n                Step 6: Evaluate Alliance or\n                  Partnership Candidates\nOnce a candidate (or candidates) has signaled an initial willingness to\nproceed, the process of detailed assessment begins. Evaluating possible\npartners is an intensive task requiring time and resources. Simply stated,\nselecting a strategic partner has longer-termconsequences if not per-\nformed properly. Often, cross-functional teams visit a supplier (and at\ntimes a supplier team may visit a purchaser) to assess the candidate\u2019s \ufb01t\nand capabilities.",

                "text": "If these suppliers also\nprovide items and services that are strategic to the purchaser, then op-\nportunities may exist for pursuing a collaborative relationship. At times\na \ufb01rm may want to search outside its current supply base. Forming an\nalliance or partnership provides an ideal occasion to search for the best\nsupply sources wherever they exist.\n     Identifying an alliance or partnership candidate may be relatively\nstraightforward. A purchaser may have a longstanding relationship with\na supplier, and it may become evident that elevating the relationship to\none that formally endorses collaborative efforts makes sense. This may\nreduce the time required to plan and execute the agreement, since the\nparticipants likely have a working knowledge of each other. The poten-\ntial partners may also have developed a level of trust. Experience indi-\ncates that the parties to a higher-level alliance or partnership often have 176                   PART 2  The Strategic Approaches of Purchasing and Supply\nsome history or experience between them before initiating a strategic\nagreement.\n        Step 5: Initiate Executive Level Contact\n                    between Companies\nWhile lower-level alliances and partnerships typically feature manager-\nto-manager contact, strategic alliances and partnerships capture the at-\ntention of executive management. Indeed, an executive manager of one\ncompany may discuss with an executive manager of another company\nthe possibility of pursuing a collaborative relationship. If executive man-\nagement feels comfortable with this idea, then the process may proceed\nto the next level of development. At this point executive managers usu-\nally assign ownership and responsibility for further discussion to an in-\ndividual or group elsewhere in the organization. Detailed planning and\nnegotiation between the parties rarely happens at the highest organiza-\ntional levels (see Step 7). However, executive managers often demon-\nstrate their commitment to the process by signing the documents gov-\nerning the alliance or partnership.\n                Step 6: Evaluate Alliance or\n                  Partnership Candidates\nOnce a candidate (or candidates) has signaled an initial willingness to\nproceed, the process of detailed assessment begins. Evaluating possible\npartners is an intensive task requiring time and resources. Simply stated,\nselecting a strategic partner has longer-termconsequences if not per-\nformed properly. Often, cross-functional teams visit a supplier (and at\ntimes a supplier team may visit a purchaser) to assess the candidate\u2019s \ufb01t\nand capabilities."

The delivery date as recorded at receiving is compared to the\non-time window. Either it was delivered within the window or it was\nnot. Every delivery is measured and determined to be on-time or not-\non-time. Delivery performance is calculated as:\n   Delivery     5    Deliveries \u2018\u2018on-time\u2019\u2019   3 100 5  % On-time\n   Performance     Total number of deliveries\n     A third consideration in maintaining a valid delivery performance\nmeasurement is FOB point. For shipments sent FOB origin, the supplier\n\u2018\u2018delivered\u2019\u2019 the goods when they loaded themonto the carrier at their\nfacility. If there were delays in transit, the buying organization owns both\nthe goods and the problem. If the supplier is measured on dock receipt\ndate, they have every right to challenge the legitimacy of the measure-\nment. Manual back correction can be time-consuming. Deliveries shipped\nFOB destination do not have this problem, since delivery measurement\nand transfer of ownership are at the same point.\nQUALITY\nMost organizations track the quality of incoming material, recording sup-\nplier, purchase order number, item number, and lot number of an incom-\ning itemand whether it passed or failed any quality checks. They tally\nthe number of lots rejected from each supplier and compare them to the\ntotal number of lots received yielding a percentage, often called the \u2018\u2018re-\nject rate.\u2019\u2019 They should also notify purchasing when there is a supplier\nquality problem.

The delivery date as recorded at receiving is compared to the\non-time window. Either it was delivered within the window or it was\nnot. Every delivery is measured and determined to be on-time or not-\non-time. Delivery performance is calculated as:\n   Delivery     5    Deliveries \u2018\u2018on-time\u2019\u2019   3 100 5  % On-time\n   Performance     Total number of deliveries\n     A third consideration in maintaining a valid delivery performance\nmeasurement is FOB point. For shipments sent FOB origin, the supplier\n\u2018\u2018delivered\u2019\u2019 the goods when they loaded themonto the carrier at their\nfacility. If there were delays in transit, the buying organization owns both\nthe goods and the problem. If the supplier is measured on dock receipt\ndate, they have every right to challenge the legitimacy of the measure-\nment. Manual back correction can be time-consuming. Deliveries shipped\nFOB destination do not have this problem, since delivery measurement\nand transfer of ownership are at the same point.\nQUALITY\nMost organizations track the quality of incoming material, recording sup-\nplier, purchase order number, item number, and lot number of an incom-\ning itemand whether it passed or failed any quality checks. They tally\nthe number of lots rejected from each supplier and compare them to the\ntotal number of lots received yielding a percentage, often called the \u2018\u2018re-\nject rate.\u2019\u2019 They should also notify purchasing when there is a supplier\nquality problem.

Since each supplier bears the costs\nderived from its own performance, this is a fair relative measure of qual-\nity (Table 31\u20137).\nLEADTIME\nLeadtime is a performance factor. Items with a leadtime of four weeks\nwill be managed differently than those with a leadtime of 12 weeks.\nLong-leadtime items limit your \ufb02exibility in changing your schedule to\naccommodate changes in the business. They may also be a major driver\nof safety stock inventory. Since measurements drive behavior, measuring\nleadtime as a cost factor also sends a message to the supply base that\nleadtime matters and less is better.\n     To derive a formula for the cost of leadtime, start with the cost of\ncarrying inventory stated as a percent per year. Divide that by 52 to\nobtain the percent per week. Determine whether that formula is strong\nenough to send the appropriate message to suppliers about how much\nyou value leadtime reduction. If it does not carry the weight you deem\nappropriate, increase the percentage per week until the weight is appro-\npriate. Formulae of 1\u20132% per week are typical. Once the appropriate\npercentage has been determined, apply it by multiplying the percentage\nby the supplier\u2019s quoted leadtime and adding the result to their quoted\nprice as the performance factor for leadtime (Table 31\u20138). 800                                    PART 4  Components and Capabilities\n  T A B    L E     31\u20138\n  Lead Time Calculations Example\n      Factor            Able Co.

Raw materials must\n meet the needs of many processing technologies as the material passes\n through the manufacturing process. For example, in the production of a\n steel fabrication, the material must be formed, welded, and \ufb01nished.\n Each of these process technologies requires different material character-\n istics for optimal processing. Leading-edge companies attempt to mea-\n sure total processing costs (effectiveness), not workstation costs (ef\ufb01-\n ciency). This approach optimizes the system cost rather than attempting\n to de\ufb01ne material speci\ufb01cations that favor one process over another and\n thus result in higher total processing costs.\n      To achieve the lowest total cost, a buyer needs to work across all\n process technologies required to produce a product. Most important is\n the early involvement of suppliers in design. The role of the purchaser\n is to help the business make wise decisions by assisting such functions\n as design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and shop operations\n in assessing trade-offs, so that the lowest total cost is achieved.\n \u00a9 2000 Haluch & Associates Ltd.\n                                                                    809\nCopyright 2000 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

C H A P T E R           32\n      Purchase of Raw Materials\n      and Commodities\n      Editor\n      Frank Haluch, C.P.M.\n      President\n      Haluch & Associates Ltd.\n DIFFERENT PURCHASING\n Buying raw materials and commodities is different from buying services,\n component parts, or fully manufactured products. Raw materials must\n meet the needs of many processing technologies as the material passes\n through the manufacturing process. For example, in the production of a\n steel fabrication, the material must be formed, welded, and \ufb01nished.\n Each of these process technologies requires different material character-\n istics for optimal processing. Leading-edge companies attempt to mea-\n sure total processing costs (effectiveness), not workstation costs (ef\ufb01-\n ciency). This approach optimizes the system cost rather than attempting\n to de\ufb01ne material speci\ufb01cations that favor one process over another and\n thus result in higher total processing costs.\n      To achieve the lowest total cost, a buyer needs to work across all\n process technologies required to produce a product. Most important is\n the early involvement of suppliers in design. The role of the purchaser\n is to help the business make wise decisions by assisting such functions\n as design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and shop operations\n in assessing trade-offs, so that the lowest total cost is achieved.\n \u00a9 2000 Haluch & Associates Ltd.\n                                                                    809\nCopyright 2000 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Physical and mechanical properties are as\nillustrated in Box 32\u20131.\n                             Commodities\nCommodities can be crude or re\ufb01ned products such as oil, chemicals,\nminerals, ores, and agricultural products that are used as the building\nblocks for other products.

Use of a brand name\nmeans that the purchaser is relying on the manufacturer to supply the\nsame-quality material, lot after lot. However, this approach may lock out\npotential product improvements brought out by competitors. Using in-\ndustry standards provides a wider choice of potential suppliers but at\nthe same time introduces more variability into the system. Industry stan-\ndards generally state material characteristics in terms of maximums or\nminimums. Thus two materials that meet an industry standard may be-\nhave very differently during processing. Often the best way to ensure\nthat the material purchased meets both your \ufb01rm\u2019s and the end cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs is to develop a material speci\ufb01cation that de\ufb01nes both\nphysical and mechanical properties.\nHAZARDOUS MATERIAL\nSome raw materials and commodities have been designated as hazard-\nous materials. A purchaser should not rely exclusively on the seller to\nensure that this type of material is packaged and shipped properly.\nLARGEST SOURCE OF UNFAVORABLE\nCOST VARIANCE\nIn many industries, raw materials represent the largest single source of\nvariable cost. Those costs also have the potential of being the largest\nsource  of unplanned,  unfavorable  cost variance. As such,  they can\ndramatically impact a \ufb01rm\u2019s contribution margin (sales price 2 variable\ncost 5 contribution margin).

                "text": "WHAT IT IS CALLED IS IMPORTANT\nThe method chosen to describe a requirement to suppliers will affect both\nthe price paid and the type of material received. Use of a brand name\nmeans that the purchaser is relying on the manufacturer to supply the\nsame-quality material, lot after lot. However, this approach may lock out\npotential product improvements brought out by competitors. Using in-\ndustry standards provides a wider choice of potential suppliers but at\nthe same time introduces more variability into the system. Industry stan-\ndards generally state material characteristics in terms of maximums or\nminimums. Thus two materials that meet an industry standard may be-\nhave very differently during processing. Often the best way to ensure\nthat the material purchased meets both your \ufb01rm\u2019s and the end cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs is to develop a material speci\ufb01cation that de\ufb01nes both\nphysical and mechanical properties.\nHAZARDOUS MATERIAL\nSome raw materials and commodities have been designated as hazard-\nous materials. A purchaser should not rely exclusively on the seller to\nensure that this type of material is packaged and shipped properly.\nLARGEST SOURCE OF UNFAVORABLE\nCOST VARIANCE\nIn many industries, raw materials represent the largest single source of\nvariable cost. Those costs also have the potential of being the largest\nsource  of unplanned,  unfavorable  cost variance. As such,  they can\ndramatically impact a \ufb01rm\u2019s contribution margin (sales price 2 variable\ncost 5 contribution margin). Changes in variable costs can have a large\nimpact on operating income.

CHAPTER 32  Purchase of Raw Materials and Commodities              817\nLESSONS LEARNED\nAs one can imagine, mistakes have been made as purchasers have at-\ntempted to utilize this technology. Some of the lessons that have been\nlearned are:\n    \u2666  Rigorous supplier prequali\ufb01cation is critical; it is the key to\n       success.\n    \u2666  You should get electronic bid packages on-line early.\n    \u2666  You should double- and triple-check all data for accuracy.\n    \u2666  Target prices ensure success.\n    \u2666  You should oversell and overeducate your suppliers on the\n       initial event.\n    \u2666  You should make sure suppliers understand the \u2018\u2018rules.\u2019\u2019\nCONTRACTING FOR\nSIMILAR REQUIREMENTS\nContracting involves more than requesting bids and awarding the busi-\nness to the lowest price bidder. Contracting for raw materials and com-\nmodities requires input from engineering, the use of trial runs, and a\ngreat deal of cooperation among purchasing, engineering, and opera-\ntions. As a rule, successful contracting is achieved through the use of\nmultifunctional teams. The \ufb01rst step is to level the playing \ufb01eld, i.e., to\nrationalize the speci\ufb01cations that are currently being used to purchase\nthe material. The next step is to determine which suppliers\u2019 material\nmeets the new speci\ufb01cation.",

This means they have downloaded the request for\nquotation, passed all of the quali\ufb01cation and prescreening hurdles, and\nanalyzed the RFQ for business and are prepared to submit bids.\n     The electronic auction works through software that integrates the\nbuyer and sellers so that everyone appears to be in the same room (ex-\ncept that the sellers do not know the name of the company that is bid-\nding, just the price they have bid). Each provider runs its competitive\nbidding events differently, so it important to review their products care-\nfully prior to scheduling a competitive bidding event. CHAPTER 32  Purchase of Raw Materials and Commodities              817\nLESSONS LEARNED\nAs one can imagine, mistakes have been made as purchasers have at-\ntempted to utilize this technology. Some of the lessons that have been\nlearned are:\n    \u2666  Rigorous supplier prequali\ufb01cation is critical; it is the key to\n       success.\n    \u2666  You should get electronic bid packages on-line early.\n    \u2666  You should double- and triple-check all data for accuracy.\n    \u2666  Target prices ensure success.\n    \u2666  You should oversell and overeducate your suppliers on the\n       initial event.\n    \u2666  You should make sure suppliers understand the \u2018\u2018rules.\u2019\u2019\nCONTRACTING FOR\nSIMILAR REQUIREMENTS\nContracting involves more than requesting bids and awarding the busi-\nness to the lowest price bidder. Contracting for raw materials and com-\nmodities requires input from engineering, the use of trial runs, and a\ngreat deal of cooperation among purchasing, engineering, and opera-\ntions. As a rule, successful contracting is achieved through the use of\nmultifunctional teams. The \ufb01rst step is to level the playing \ufb01eld, i.e., to\nrationalize the speci\ufb01cations that are currently being used to purchase\nthe material. The next step is to determine which suppliers\u2019 material\nmeets the new speci\ufb01cation."

The mills \ufb01t the new\nmanufacturing paradigm: low volume, high mix, and fast response. In a\ncompetitive market that increasingly is being driven to shorter manufac-\nturing cycle times of small lots, specialty manufacturers are becoming a\ngreater force in the marketplace. Faster delivery of smaller lot sizes adds\nvalue for the purchaser because it reduces total costs and improves cus-\ntomer service.\nBUYING FROM THE PRODUCER OR FROM\nTHE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM\nMost people feel that buying fromthe producer is the m\n                                                     ost cost-effective\noption.

Prices tended to fall as the economy lost momentum and\nmanufacturers reduced their inventories. Prices rose as the economy\ngained strength and manufacturers increased \ufb01nished goods inventories.\nTime-based competition and a Just-in-Time manufacturing philosophy,\nhowever, tend to dampen the normal strong order demand that is usu-\nally seen as an economy begins an upturn. Therefore, in the long run,\nthe pricing of many raw materials now appears to be based more on the\ncost of production. This is particularly true of raw materials that have CHAPTER 32  Purchase of Raw Materials and Commodities              829\nlost their differentiation over time and since have become true commod-\nities.\n                      Evaluating Prices\nWhat drives price? Demand? The cost of raw materials? The cost to pro-\ncess? Is it a labor- or capital-intensive process? Understanding how a\nmaterial or a raw material is produced is the \ufb01rst step in understanding\nprice. Understanding the industry structure provides information that is\nuseful in evaluating prices, particularly in evaluating requests for price\nincreases. It is also helpful to understand how standard materials are\nclassi\ufb01ed and how their properties differ. This information may well sug-\ngest substitution possibilities.",

The\nWall Street Journal, the Journal of Commerce, and The New York Times pub-\nlish cash, futures, and option pricing on various agricultural, metals, and\npetroleumproducts. The U.S. Departm\n                                     ent of Agriculture is another ex-\ncellent  source  of information  on   agricultural products.  Industry\npublications such as Metals Week by McGraw-Hill and The Paper Trade by\nthe Lockwood Trade Journal Company are also excellent sources of pric-\ning data for metals and paper.\n  Commodity Prices is a \u2018\u2018must\u2019\u2019 book for anyone buying a wide variety\nof commodities. It references sources of pricing information from Abaca\nto Zonarex and more than 5,000 other agricultural, commercial, indus-\ntrial, and consumer products in between the two extremes.\n                 Changing Pricing Patterns\nIn the past, commodity pricing normally followed the same pattern as\nthe economy. Prices tended to fall as the economy lost momentum and\nmanufacturers reduced their inventories. Prices rose as the economy\ngained strength and manufacturers increased \ufb01nished goods inventories.\nTime-based competition and a Just-in-Time manufacturing philosophy,\nhowever, tend to dampen the normal strong order demand that is usu-\nally seen as an economy begins an upturn. Therefore, in the long run,\nthe pricing of many raw materials now appears to be based more on the\ncost of production. This is particularly true of raw materials that have CHAPTER 32  Purchase of Raw Materials and Commodities              829\nlost their differentiation over time and since have become true commod-\nities.\n                      Evaluating Prices\nWhat drives price? Demand? The cost of raw materials? The cost to pro-\ncess? Is it a labor- or capital-intensive process? Understanding how a\nmaterial or a raw material is produced is the \ufb01rst step in understanding\nprice. Understanding the industry structure provides information that is\nuseful in evaluating prices, particularly in evaluating requests for price\nincreases. It is also helpful to understand how standard materials are\nclassi\ufb01ed and how their properties differ. This information may well sug-\ngest substitution possibilities."

In some cases MRO amounts to as much as 20% of total\n purchases. Every industry and organization uses some form of MRO,\n fromof\ufb01ce supplies to lubricants to cutting tools to pipe \ufb01ttings to clean-\n ing supplies, to mention only a few MRO items.

In some cases MRO amounts to as much as 20% of total\n purchases. Every industry and organization uses some form of MRO,\n fromof\ufb01ce supplies to lubricants to cutting tools to pipe \ufb01ttings to clean-\n ing supplies, to mention only a few MRO items. While every organiza-\n tion buys MRO and in many it is a signi\ufb01cant purchase, only relatively\n recently has management focused attention on how to better manage the\n MRO buy. This chapter will discuss what MRO is, the improvement po-\n tential available from better management of the purchasing and supply\n of MRO items, traditional MRO procurement, some \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 approaches\n to managing the MRO buy, and a general approach to developing and\n implementing improvement of MRO supply management.\n WHAT IS MRO?\n MRO is a major area for potential improvement in purchasing and sup-\n ply management.

Integrated supply sometimes\nassigns to the integrated supplier all responsibility for purchasing, in-\nventorying, and delivery to the user in the purchaser\u2019s facility of all items\nincluded in the agreement. Often the supplier may operate on the cus-\ntomers premises, perhaps operating a warehouse that formerly was op-\nerated by the customer.\n       Integrated supply is often applied where there are large numbers\nof individually purchased products and many miscellaneous items can\nbe obtained fromone source. MRO is therefore usually an ideal candidate\nfor application of integrated supply.

Delivery may be made\nonce or more per day from the supplier\u2019s stock, depending on level of\nusage and type of material. For example, some maintenance materials\nmay be delivered four times per day, while of\ufb01ce supplies may be deliv-\nered only once per day. In particularly high-usage situations where the\nsupplier does not operate on the customer\u2019s premises, the supplier may\nplace one of more employees on the customer\u2019s premises to function as\ncombination suppliers and purchasers and provide communication and\ncoordination between supplier locations and purchasing company per-\nsonnel.\n   Just-in-Time is applied where large quantities of material are pur-\nchased fromone supplier, usually involving frequent orders. A high level\nof coordination between purchaser and supplier \ufb01rms is required for\nsuccessful operation.\n                          SupplierCity\nA supplier city consists of one supplier fromeach of a num\n                                                         ber of pur-\nchased product lines co-located near the purchaser\u2019s location or near a\nlarge complex that includes multiple purchasers. Normally each supplier\nwould provide all purchasing and supply management services for their\nproducts. The concept is similar to integrated supply but potentially in-\ncludes multiple product lines and multiple customers.\n      The supplier city concept obviously requires either a very large\ncustomer operation or a large complex of several customers facilities lo-\ncated near each other.",

                "text": "For example, if a\ncompany now has three suppliers for electrical MRO items, an integrated\nsupply arrangement would have only one supplier for electrical MRO\nitems, and that supplier would have to obtain or arrange for supply of\nitems not previously in their product lines. Integrated supply sometimes\nassigns to the integrated supplier all responsibility for purchasing, in-\nventorying, and delivery to the user in the purchaser\u2019s facility of all items\nincluded in the agreement. Often the supplier may operate on the cus-\ntomers premises, perhaps operating a warehouse that formerly was op-\nerated by the customer.\n       Integrated supply is often applied where there are large numbers\nof individually purchased products and many miscellaneous items can\nbe obtained fromone source. MRO is therefore usually an ideal candidate\nfor application of integrated supply. CHAPTER 33  MRO Materials                                          841\n                             Just-In-Time\nJust-in-Time usually implies that the buying organization maintains no\ninventory and that the supplier delivers whatever has been agreed upon\njust as it is needed by the purchaser\u2019s employees. Delivery may be made\nonce or more per day from the supplier\u2019s stock, depending on level of\nusage and type of material. For example, some maintenance materials\nmay be delivered four times per day, while of\ufb01ce supplies may be deliv-\nered only once per day. In particularly high-usage situations where the\nsupplier does not operate on the customer\u2019s premises, the supplier may\nplace one of more employees on the customer\u2019s premises to function as\ncombination suppliers and purchasers and provide communication and\ncoordination between supplier locations and purchasing company per-\nsonnel.\n   Just-in-Time is applied where large quantities of material are pur-\nchased fromone supplier, usually involving frequent orders. A high level\nof coordination between purchaser and supplier \ufb01rms is required for\nsuccessful operation.\n                          SupplierCity\nA supplier city consists of one supplier fromeach of a num\n                                                         ber of pur-\nchased product lines co-located near the purchaser\u2019s location or near a\nlarge complex that includes multiple purchasers. Normally each supplier\nwould provide all purchasing and supply management services for their\nproducts. The concept is similar to integrated supply but potentially in-\ncludes multiple product lines and multiple customers.\n      The supplier city concept obviously requires either a very large\ncustomer operation or a large complex of several customers facilities lo-\ncated near each other."

Without the source code, the licensee cannot per-\nform regular maintenance on the system.\n     On the one hand, the source code (relating to software) will be a\ntrade secret of the software supplier, and the supplier will be reluctant\nto provide it to third parties. However, the user will want to make sure\nthat the software will be maintained no matter what happens to the\nvendor.\n One approach to resolving the interests of both licensee and licensor\nis to establish an escrow account into which the source code is deposited.",

In addition, Licensee shall have the right, at no charge, to assign\n     this Agreement to a third party who assumes the responsibility of Li-\n     censee\u2019s data processing function.\n        The Source Code Escrow Agreement\nIf a software supplier goes out of business or simply stops maintaining\nthe software, this will cause great harmto the licensee. In the case of a\ncomputer system, the user\u2019s system may be rendered virtually useless.\nThe user may be forced to obtain a replacement source, the cost of which\ncould be substantial. 870                                       PART 5 Itemand Industry Practice\n    The source code is the code used by the software developer to cre-\nate the software. It is typically in a different computer language than the\nobject code (the language the licensee uses to \u2018\u2018read,\u2019\u2019 install, and use the\nsoftware) and is considered to be valuable proprietary information be-\nlonging to the licensor. Without the source code, the licensee cannot per-\nform regular maintenance on the system.\n     On the one hand, the source code (relating to software) will be a\ntrade secret of the software supplier, and the supplier will be reluctant\nto provide it to third parties. However, the user will want to make sure\nthat the software will be maintained no matter what happens to the\nvendor.\n One approach to resolving the interests of both licensee and licensor\nis to establish an escrow account into which the source code is deposited."

Wright\n       President\n       B. Wright & Associates and TotalSystems, Inc.\n  WHAT IS CAPITAL?\n  There are many de\ufb01nitions of capital and the use of capital in an orga-\n  nization. The idea of capital is discussed and debated by many people\n  and organizations. There is a basic premise that capital only goes where\n  it is invited and remains only if made to feel welcome. This is very true\n  when considering the purchase of capital assets.\n       Capital is another word for money or value, and expenditure denotes\n  the trade of money or value for something else of value. This in a direct\n  sense is the de\ufb01nition of a capital expenditure. This is probably why\n  there is such a broad application of the termin organizations. Accounting\n  has attempted to apply their own de\ufb01nition by making capital expen-\n  diture synonymous with depreciable asset. In today\u2019s world of manage-\n  ment accounting, this is not a true de\ufb01nition of the term. Capital expen-\n  diture is more aligned with the term \ufb01xed asset in today\u2019s world.

Wright\n       President\n       B. Wright & Associates and TotalSystems, Inc.\n  WHAT IS CAPITAL?\n  There are many de\ufb01nitions of capital and the use of capital in an orga-\n  nization. The idea of capital is discussed and debated by many people\n  and organizations. There is a basic premise that capital only goes where\n  it is invited and remains only if made to feel welcome. This is very true\n  when considering the purchase of capital assets.\n       Capital is another word for money or value, and expenditure denotes\n  the trade of money or value for something else of value. This in a direct\n  sense is the de\ufb01nition of a capital expenditure. This is probably why\n  there is such a broad application of the termin organizations. Accounting\n  has attempted to apply their own de\ufb01nition by making capital expen-\n  diture synonymous with depreciable asset. In today\u2019s world of manage-\n  ment accounting, this is not a true de\ufb01nition of the term. Capital expen-\n  diture is more aligned with the term \ufb01xed asset in today\u2019s world. A \ufb01xed\n  asset is any asset that lasts more than a year, with an impact on share-\n  holder value, and is considered by management worth controlling. This\n  is much broader than the current accounting de\ufb01nition. That de\ufb01nition\n  is determined by each organization relative to time and value related to\n  materiality.

They will generally fall into three broad\ncategories:\n     1.  Must projects: Projects that affect the continued operation of the\n         company; management usually has no choice about whether\n         they will be done or not. Often they are needed to satisfy a\n         regulatory requirement or an emergency replacement of\n         existing capacity. In addition, there are special projects,\n         sometimes called pets or strategic projects, that in no way\n         re\ufb02ect a return on investment but are the perks of\n         management. These might include a corporate airplane,\n         corporate yacht, or other projects that are included in the\n         image of the organization rather than the operation.\n     2.  Want projects: Projects that provide some type of real\n         improvement and are desirable from their risk reward\n         position. These are projects that show low risk and high return\n         and will be of direct bene\ufb01t to the bottomline of the com\n                                                                 pany.\n         One hopes the bulk of the projects in an organization will fall\n         into the want category.\n     3.

CHAPTER 35   Capital and Its Impact on the Organization              889\nProject Priorities\nA capital forecast is essential in selecting and assigning priorities to pro-\njects, the sumtotal of which usually far exceeds the funds available.\n      Most companies require that proposed projects be rated as to their\ndegree of urgency or desirability. They will generally fall into three broad\ncategories:\n     1.  Must projects: Projects that affect the continued operation of the\n         company; management usually has no choice about whether\n         they will be done or not. Often they are needed to satisfy a\n         regulatory requirement or an emergency replacement of\n         existing capacity. In addition, there are special projects,\n         sometimes called pets or strategic projects, that in no way\n         re\ufb02ect a return on investment but are the perks of\n         management. These might include a corporate airplane,\n         corporate yacht, or other projects that are included in the\n         image of the organization rather than the operation.\n     2.  Want projects: Projects that provide some type of real\n         improvement and are desirable from their risk reward\n         position. These are projects that show low risk and high return\n         and will be of direct bene\ufb01t to the bottomline of the com\n                                                                 pany.\n         One hopes the bulk of the projects in an organization will fall\n         into the want category.\n     3.  Wish projects: Projects that carry either a high risk or relatively\n         low reward for the company. These are projects that may be\n         out of the company\u2019s operational expertise but may show a\n         high reward potential.

The availability of the \ufb01nancing method\nLong-termdebt includes bonds, m\n                                 ortgages, and long-termsecured \ufb01-\nnancing.\nBond Cost\nLet\u2019s say we can issue bonds with face values of $100 per bond and it is\nestimated that the bond will generate $96 net proceeds to the company\nafter discounting and \ufb01nancing costs. The normal interest is $14, or ap-\nproximately $9 after taxes (assuming a 35% tax rate). To obtain the cost,\nwe divide the after-tax interest by the proceeds:\n       $9 5 9.375%, which is the after-tax cost of bond financing\n      $96\nMortgage and Long-Term Financing Costs\nOur banker has informed us that our long-term rate is two points over\nprime. Prime is currently 10%, which puts our lending rate at 12%. With\na 35% tax rate it comes to a 7.8% cost. Our banker has informed us that\nour mortgage rates are presently 11%, which would give us an after-tax\ncost on mortgage money of 7.15%. 896                                      PART 5 Itemand Industry Practice\nWeighting the Cost of Long-Term Debt                   To weight the\ncost of long-termdebt, we take the average of the costs of long-term\ndebt, which would give us\n                        7.8% 1 7.15% 5 7.48%\n                             2\nand multiply the long-term debt ($500,000) by that factor, which will give\nus a weighted average cost of $37,400.\n                   Preferred Stock Costs\nWe must take the present market value or an estimate of that value less\ndiscounts or \ufb01nance costs and divide dividends or cash \ufb02ow per share\nby this value. Example: Preferred $100 per share less $2 \ufb01nance costs or\n$98.00 proceeds. Cash \ufb02ow or dividends on preferred are $11 per share."

Overhead: Because the evaluation of a capital expenditure is\n         based on incremental cash \ufb02ow based on the project itself,\n         there is normally no consideration in the project itself for\n         overhead. This is added to the hurdle rate to make sure the\n         return covers the portion of overhead that should be\n         supported by this project.\n     4.  Relative risk: Another factor in our hurdle rate is the risk\n         factors of the projects we expect to undertake. As the risk\n         increases, it is natural that we would expect to receive a\n         greater return for that risk. Most companies will set a\n         minimum hurdle rate for prime projects and then increase\n         that rate according to the risk of that project relative to\n         prime projects.\n                           Hurdle Rate\nAfter evaluation of the above factors, we can settle on a hurdle rate or\nseries of hurdle rates, depending on our approach.

(Average annual pro\ufb01t)/(Average investment)\n      A de\ufb01nition of the factors used:\n      Total profit 5 Total net inflows 2 Total net outflows\n      Average annual profit 5 Total profit/Number of years in project life\n      Average investment 5 Nondepreciable portion\n                            1  (1 2 tax rate)(depreciable portion)\n      An example of accountant\u2019s rate of return using the example above\nwould be:\n      Total profit (inflows 2 outflows) 5 $2,500 2 $1,800 5 $700\n      Average annual profit 5 $700 5 $233\n                                3\n      Average investment 5 0 1  (1 2 0.34) ($1,800) 5 $1,188\n      The accountant\u2019s rate of return in each case would be: 902                                       PART 5  Itemand Industry Practice\n                     Method 1:    $700  5 58.92%\n                                 $1,188\n                     Method 2:    $233  5 12.94%\n                                 $1,800\n                     Method 3:    $233  5 19.61%\n                                 $1,188\nUse of the Accountant\u2019s Rate of Return                   If there are no\nconstraints, select all projects above an arbitrary rate of return cutoff; if\nthere are budget constraints select projects with the highest rates of re-\nturn.\nAdvantages of Accountant\u2019s Rate of Return                          This\nmethod gives a cash on cash return without taking the time value of\nmoney into consideration."

Negotiation may be exploratory and\nserve to formulate viewpoints and delineate areas of agreement or con-\ntention. It may aim at working out practical arrangements. The success\nof negotiation depends upon whether (a) the issue is negotiable (that is, 914                                        PART 5  Itemand Industry Practice\n  you can sell your car but not your child); (b) the negotiators are inter-\n  ested not only in taking, but also in giving; are able to exchange value\n  for value; and are willing to compromise; and (c) there is a trust level\n  between negotiating parties."

This is not\n         often done, but it should be considered where the identi\ufb01cation\n         of the construction will become an integral part of the image\n         of the organization.\n          In most cases the \ufb01rst level will be enough, but the purchaser\nshould consider their position before the establishment of the payment\nfor the proposal.\n         If the company that makes the proposal also becomes the general\ncontractor for the project and will carry the construction to completion,\nthen we would go directly to negotiation of contract and not make this\na two-step process."

This pricing type is used for a wide range of construction and\ncontracting services: temporary of\ufb01ce help, security services, construc-\ntion materials, and so on; or for other trades work where quantities may\nnot completely be established for the work in question.\nCost-Plus Types\nThe following \ufb01ve types of contract pricing alternatives are all cost-plus.\nIn each one, the purchasing \ufb01rmreim\n                                    burses the contractor for all costs\nplus an overhead percentage (usually based on costs) plus a contractor\u2019s\npro\ufb01t.\nCost-Plus, Fixed Pro\ufb01t            The contractor is reimbursed for all\ndirect costs and for overhead and administration at a predetermined per-\ncentage of the labor costs. The contractor\u2019s pro\ufb01t is a \ufb01xed amount. The\npro\ufb01t amount is altered only if the speci\ufb01cations and scope of the job\nare changed fromthe original contract agreem\n                                            ent. This pricing type can\nbe used for all types of construction in which there are insuf\ufb01cient design\nspeci\ufb01cations to bid a pure \ufb01xed price, but the speci\ufb01cations are complete\nenough to avoid a percentage fee arrangement.\nCost-Plus, Percentage Pro\ufb01t                The contractor is reimbursed\nfor all direct costs plus a percentage of labor costs for overhead and\nadministrative expenses."

Generally, there is no single\npricing alternative that is best. The best choice varies depending on the\nvarious elements of the project. A key consideration in selecting the pric-\ning alternative is the assignment of risk and the required management\ncontrols necessary to minimize risks. Many purchasers are using model-\ning techniques to assess the risks and opportunities of these types of\nprocesses.\nTHE USE OF MODELING IN\nCONSTRUCTION PURCHASING\nWhat will that construction project cost? What will it cost to \ufb01nish that\nconstruction job? How much will productivity increase if we install that\nnew equipment in our plant? How many staff-hours will it take to design\nthat new system? In other words, \u2018\u2018 What is your best estimate?\u2019\u2019\n     Estimating is an integral part of planning, and we do a lot of it.\nMany of us seem to be on an \u2018\u2018estimating merry-go-round.\u2019\u2019 Much of our\ntime is devoted to estimating costs, productivity, pro\ufb01ts, and a multitude\nof other performance measures. And around and around it goes. It very\nmuch looks like \u2018\u2018the business is estimating.\u2019\u2019\n       Doing a good job of estimating brings plaudits and pro\ufb01ts. Doing\na poor one can bring bankruptcy. It is not surprising, then, that we spend\na lot of time and money on estimating. We harness rivers of data. We\n\ufb01lter the data. We polish the data. We re\ufb02ect upon the data. Then, \ufb01nally,\nwe make our selection of \u2018\u2018the right number,\u2019\u2019 holding it up for all the\nworld to see.

Generally, there is no single\npricing alternative that is best. The best choice varies depending on the\nvarious elements of the project. A key consideration in selecting the pric-\ning alternative is the assignment of risk and the required management\ncontrols necessary to minimize risks. Many purchasers are using model-\ning techniques to assess the risks and opportunities of these types of\nprocesses.\nTHE USE OF MODELING IN\nCONSTRUCTION PURCHASING\nWhat will that construction project cost? What will it cost to \ufb01nish that\nconstruction job? How much will productivity increase if we install that\nnew equipment in our plant? How many staff-hours will it take to design\nthat new system? In other words, \u2018\u2018 What is your best estimate?\u2019\u2019\n     Estimating is an integral part of planning, and we do a lot of it.\nMany of us seem to be on an \u2018\u2018estimating merry-go-round.\u2019\u2019 Much of our\ntime is devoted to estimating costs, productivity, pro\ufb01ts, and a multitude\nof other performance measures. And around and around it goes. It very\nmuch looks like \u2018\u2018the business is estimating.\u2019\u2019\n       Doing a good job of estimating brings plaudits and pro\ufb01ts. Doing\na poor one can bring bankruptcy. It is not surprising, then, that we spend\na lot of time and money on estimating. We harness rivers of data. We\n\ufb01lter the data. We polish the data. We re\ufb02ect upon the data. Then, \ufb01nally,\nwe make our selection of \u2018\u2018the right number,\u2019\u2019 holding it up for all the\nworld to see.

For ex-\nample, an element may account for a very large portion of the bottom-\nline cost of the project but have very little or no potential for variation.\nIn other words, the actual value of the element cannot be suf\ufb01ciently\ndifferent fromits target, either favorably or unfavorably, to produce a 954                                       PART 5  Itemand Industry Practice\nbottomline change that is greater than the critical variance. Such an el-\nement is noncritical. On the other hand, another element may account\nfor a very small portion of the bottomline cost but can vary from target,\neither favorably or unfavorably, by such a degree that the bottomline\nchange would be greater than the critical variance. An element such as\nthis is critical.\n                 Uncertainty: Measure It to Manage It\nIn the real world, the actual value of a critical element can be any of\nhundreds or thousands of values. For example, if a critical element\u2019s\ntarget is 16,000 man-hours and its actual value can be anywhere between\n14,000 and 20,500 man-hours, then, if we count only the whole numbers,\nthe actual can be any one of 6,501 possibilities, only one of which is the\ntarget of 16,000 man-hours. Although there are relatively few critical el-\nements, there is a tremendous number of ways in which their possible\nvalues can combine in the real world to produce the actual bottomline\ncost of the project. For example, if there are just ten critical elements,\neach with only ten possible values, they can combine in 10 billion pos-\nsible ways to produce the actual bottomline cost.

                "text": "Furthermore, range estimating puts the critical element\u2019s target into\nproper perspective. The target is but a single number in a spectrum of\npossible numbers. The range, no matter how subjective it may be, is far\nmore valuable for decision-making than any single number from within\nit\u2014including the target. This makes six tons of sense. How could the\ntarget, a single number, be as valuable as the range from which it comes?\nMost of us understand this dangerous de\ufb01ciency in single-point esti-\nmates and, if we are given a choice, make use of ranges to describe the\nfuture. Crudely put, by using ranges rather than single targets, we prefer\nto be approximately right rather than exactly wrong.\n        There are several PC-based programs that will allow the purchaser\nto create a model with the contractor. Most of the good construction\nmanagement \ufb01rms now use models in project management and evalu-\nation of project processes. These programs are available on the Internet\nand fromsoftware providers. CHAPTER 37  Construction Services Procurement                       957\n CONTRACT CONTENT FOR PROTECTION OF\n THE PURCHASING ORGANIZATION\n It is generally best to have two segments to the agreement between the\n purchasing organization and the contractor. The \ufb01rst is the terms and\n conditions agreement, which is executed up front during the capital eval-\n uation phase. This provides an umbrella agreement that can cover rela-\n tionships with the suppliers under any conditions. It should contain the\n boilerplate and only needs to be executed once. The other segment is the\n construction contract or contracts between the purchaser and the con-\n tractor. The makeup of typical terms and conditions and the construction\n contract can very well follow a general pattern including the principal\n segments described below.\n            Terms and Conditions Agreement\nThe Recital\n It is good protection for the purchaser to describe carefully the parties\n to the contract, including the company\u2019s of\ufb01cial location and name. The\n recital should include a fairly comprehensive description of the project,\n whether the contract is for specialty work or is a general contract for the\n entire job. The recital sets the position of the parties in the terms and\n conditions agreement and sets a standard for all contracts under its um-\n brella."

Property taxes are levied by many states on the\nbasis of ownership.\nCompensation\nThe methods used to compensate the contractor must be described com-\npletely. This description should be prepared carefully to establish the\nmost practical means of administering the contract, both in the \ufb01eld and\nthe of\ufb01ce. Construction contracts contain some provisions, such as reten-\ntion of payment and partial payment for uninstalled but received goods,\nthat are not normally present in purchase orders for materials and equip-\nment. They are typical in construction contracts, however, and can be\nmade very workable.\nSchedule of Payments\nThe exact timing to which both parties have agreed for submitting in-\nvoices or approving deliverables if no invoicing is used and making pay-\nments should be stated in the contract. At times it is desirable to pay for\nsome costs such as materials and equipment rentals on a monthly basis CHAPTER 37  Construction Services Procurement                       961\nand for others such as salaries on a more frequent basis. Reimbursements\nby the purchaser for payments to subcontractors must also be scheduled.\n       Contracts that include a fee or separate pro\ufb01t usually de\ufb01ne the\npayment schedule for the fee or pro\ufb01t. Incentive fee or pro\ufb01t contracts\nshould hold back enough of the fee or pro\ufb01t to make necessary adjust-\nments for contractor performance. A retention of 5\u201310%, depending on\nthe size of the project, is usually considered reasonable.

It is much\nbetter to do this prior to the start of work on the job.\nSuspension of Work\nIt is customary for the purchaser to retain the right to extend the schedule\nof work to be performed or even to suspend the work and direct the\ncontractor to resume work when appropriate, with equitable adjustment\nof the contract for added costs caused by the suspension.",

                "text": "Title to Work Ownership\nA mutually satisfactory statement concerning the timing of the title trans-\nfer for the job is important; ownership of materials and equipment is\nparticularly signi\ufb01cant. Property taxes are levied by many states on the\nbasis of ownership.\nCompensation\nThe methods used to compensate the contractor must be described com-\npletely. This description should be prepared carefully to establish the\nmost practical means of administering the contract, both in the \ufb01eld and\nthe of\ufb01ce. Construction contracts contain some provisions, such as reten-\ntion of payment and partial payment for uninstalled but received goods,\nthat are not normally present in purchase orders for materials and equip-\nment. They are typical in construction contracts, however, and can be\nmade very workable.\nSchedule of Payments\nThe exact timing to which both parties have agreed for submitting in-\nvoices or approving deliverables if no invoicing is used and making pay-\nments should be stated in the contract. At times it is desirable to pay for\nsome costs such as materials and equipment rentals on a monthly basis CHAPTER 37  Construction Services Procurement                       961\nand for others such as salaries on a more frequent basis. Reimbursements\nby the purchaser for payments to subcontractors must also be scheduled.\n       Contracts that include a fee or separate pro\ufb01t usually de\ufb01ne the\npayment schedule for the fee or pro\ufb01t. Incentive fee or pro\ufb01t contracts\nshould hold back enough of the fee or pro\ufb01t to make necessary adjust-\nments for contractor performance. A retention of 5\u201310%, depending on\nthe size of the project, is usually considered reasonable. This \u2018\u2018hold-back\u2019\u2019\nis to help supply an incentive for the contractor to \ufb01nish the job as early\nas possible and avoid errors or omissions.\nTermination\nWhen writing a termination or deferment provision to the contract, give\ncareful attention to the numerous details of the physical movement of\npeople and material and the ultimate costs of these activities. It is much\nbetter to do this prior to the start of work on the job.\nSuspension of Work\nIt is customary for the purchaser to retain the right to extend the schedule\nof work to be performed or even to suspend the work and direct the\ncontractor to resume work when appropriate, with equitable adjustment\nof the contract for added costs caused by the suspension."

Higher\ntransportation costs may be offset by greater savings in other areas. The\npurchaser must attempt to optimize service needs to achieve the lowest\ntotal cost.\nJUST-IN-TIME, QUICK RESPONSE, AND\nEFFICIENT CONSUMER RESPONSE\nFor the Just-in-Time process to work effectively, carriers must provide\ntransit time on extremely tight schedules. Deviation from these schedules CHAPTER 38  Transportation and Related Services                      965\ncan result in substantially higher costs in the process. The carriers se-\nlected must be willing to negotiate tight schedules and provide a means\nof information \ufb02ow such as electronic data interchange (EDI) to allow\nfor tracing of inbound materials and con\ufb01rmation of scheduled deliver-\nies. The ability of purchasing to negotiate these selective services plays\nan important part in implementing a Just-in-Time system. Supporting\nquick response (QR) and ef\ufb01cient consumer response (ECR) activities\nalso require the same characteristics for outbound carriers.\nFUNCTIONAL BOUNDARY SPANNING\n                     The Integrated Team Approach\nThe establishment of a transportation program, no matter what the size\nof the company, requires team commitment from within the company,\nwith information sharing and cooperation between a number of groups,\nincluding senior management. The level of pro\ufb01ciency this program\nachieves will depend upon the stability and long-term commitment\nbrought to the effort.

                "text": "REDUCING TRANSPORTATION COSTS\nPurchasing can in\ufb02uence a \ufb01rm\u2019s bottomline by optimizing transporta-\ntion services to meet the goals of the \ufb01rm. Through effective planning\nand negotiating, purchasing may limit its carrier base and obtain better\npricing and services fromthose carriers m\n                                        eeting the \ufb01rm\n                                                      \u2019s service re-\nquirements.\nCOST TRADE-OFFS AND THE TOTAL\nCOST CONCEPT\nPurchasing transportation services requires the purchaser to consider a\nvariety of cost trade-offs, including speed of delivery, accessibility, reli-\nability, damage, inventory carrying costs, lot sizes, and theft. Higher\ntransportation costs may be offset by greater savings in other areas. The\npurchaser must attempt to optimize service needs to achieve the lowest\ntotal cost.\nJUST-IN-TIME, QUICK RESPONSE, AND\nEFFICIENT CONSUMER RESPONSE\nFor the Just-in-Time process to work effectively, carriers must provide\ntransit time on extremely tight schedules. Deviation from these schedules CHAPTER 38  Transportation and Related Services                      965\ncan result in substantially higher costs in the process. The carriers se-\nlected must be willing to negotiate tight schedules and provide a means\nof information \ufb02ow such as electronic data interchange (EDI) to allow\nfor tracing of inbound materials and con\ufb01rmation of scheduled deliver-\nies. The ability of purchasing to negotiate these selective services plays\nan important part in implementing a Just-in-Time system. Supporting\nquick response (QR) and ef\ufb01cient consumer response (ECR) activities\nalso require the same characteristics for outbound carriers.\nFUNCTIONAL BOUNDARY SPANNING\n                     The Integrated Team Approach\nThe establishment of a transportation program, no matter what the size\nof the company, requires team commitment from within the company,\nwith information sharing and cooperation between a number of groups,\nincluding senior management. The level of pro\ufb01ciency this program\nachieves will depend upon the stability and long-term commitment\nbrought to the effort. The principles of transportation management are\nthe same in both large and small \ufb01rms.\n         The transportation team typically consists of members from pur-\nchasing, transportation and manufacturing, marketing and sales, ac-\ncounting, production planning, and warehousing."

Disclosure of goods. Necessary for determining the value of\n           materials shipped. Absence of notice to the carrier about\n           speci\ufb01c goods permits the carrier to avoid paying for\n           damages.\n       2.  Responsibility of goods.

Eliminates the\n           chance of the wrong methods or equipment being used. CHAPTER 38    Transportation and Related Services                       981\n       4.  Responsibility for speci\ufb01cation. Designates which party is\n           responsible for tractors, trailers, containers, and other\n           equipment.\n       5.  Termination. Details changes in rates\u2014how, when, what notice\n           is needed, what index they will be to, etc. De\ufb01nes the\n           escalation and deescalation clauses.\n       6.",

A contract can also be negotiated\nto meet the special needs of the purchasing \ufb01rm, such as a one-time\nshipment that requires very specialized equipment (an outsized piece of\nmachinery, for example). The purchaser should research existing com-\nmon carrier class or commodity rates prior to starting negotiations with\nthe carrier or use a transportation consultant or logistics \ufb01rmwith con-\ntract experience to assist.\n     Key Elements of a Transportation Contract\nPurchasers should consider the following items when contracting for\ntransportation services.\n       1.  Disclosure of goods. Necessary for determining the value of\n           materials shipped. Absence of notice to the carrier about\n           speci\ufb01c goods permits the carrier to avoid paying for\n           damages.\n       2.  Responsibility of goods. De\ufb01nes the basis of liability as well as\n           the process for mitigating damages and claims \ufb01ling\n           procedures.\n       3.  Routing, mode, and method of transportation. Eliminates the\n           chance of the wrong methods or equipment being used. CHAPTER 38    Transportation and Related Services                       981\n       4.  Responsibility for speci\ufb01cation. Designates which party is\n           responsible for tractors, trailers, containers, and other\n           equipment.\n       5.  Termination.

These loads will then be sent to a drop location and\nprocessed through the carrier\u2019s system. One of the primary advantages\nof drop shipping is the potential for lower damage as a result of less\nhandling by the carrier. In many instances, if the shipper has a large\nnumber of shipments to be shipped, transit times may be reduced. The\nloads may be moved by an expedited driver team and dropped into one\nof the carrier facilities, thus reducing the number of days in transit.

                "text": "Reducing Costs\nIt is important to note that one of the most economical ways to increase\nservice and reduce cost is to know the carrier\u2019s service area coverage.\nService area maps may be obtained from each carrier that highlight the\nnumber of days it takes a carrier to deliver a shipment to a destination\nfrom a given origin. The major carriers move most of their next-day and\nsecond-day air shipments using surface transportation. Depending upon\nvarious cutoff times by location, the purchaser can request late pick-ups\nand have the shipment arrive at the destination by the next day at\nground rates.\n                        Shipment Consolidation\nShipment consolidation, commonly known as \u2018\u2018drop shipping,\u2019\u2019 is an ex-\ncellent method of reducing cost and receiving a unique level of service.\nThe carrier will request the shipper to split the shipments into groups\nbased on zip codes. These loads will then be sent to a drop location and\nprocessed through the carrier\u2019s system. One of the primary advantages\nof drop shipping is the potential for lower damage as a result of less\nhandling by the carrier. In many instances, if the shipper has a large\nnumber of shipments to be shipped, transit times may be reduced. The\nloads may be moved by an expedited driver team and dropped into one\nof the carrier facilities, thus reducing the number of days in transit. There\nare currently models developed by the major carriers that can provide\nthe shipper customsolutions to enable shipm\n                                           ent anywhere in the con-\ntinental United States in three days or less.

There is a potential for:\n     \u2666  Reduced labor costs\n     \u2666  Lower cost of goods\n     \u2666  Improved quality\n     \u2666  Better performance\n     \u2666  Increased customer satisfaction\n     \u2666  Preservation of scarce resources\n     \u2666  Increased pro\ufb01tability\nTHE BASIS OF VALUE\n                            De\ufb01nitions\nNote: The various concepts and use of the term product throughout this\nchapter should be interpreted as also applying to nonmanufactured\nproducts such as services in addition to physical products. The purchaser\nof services is concerned with ef\ufb01ciency of service execution and the end\nresult of the service and should keep those concepts in mind throughout\nthe chapter.\n     \u2666  Value Analysis: Value analysis is the organized and systematic\n        study of every element of cost in a part, material, or service to\n        make certain it ful\ufb01lls its function at the lowest possible cost. CHAPTER 24  Value Analysis                                          587\n        Value analysis also employs techniques that identify the\n        functions the user wants froma product or service; it\n        establishes by comparison the appropriate cost for each\n        function; then it causes the required knowledge, creativity, and\n        initiative to be used to provide each function for that cost."

The speci\ufb01cations for what was to be done,\n  how it was to be done, and how often it was to be done were very\n  general and vague. Other than cleaning being required \ufb01ve nights\n  per week, the rest was pretty much up to the contractor. Discus-\n  sions with the cleaning contractor revealed that each of\ufb01ce was vac-\n  uumed, all work surfaces dusted, and trash containers emptied\n  nightly. Additional work was done nightly in restrooms and hall-\n  ways. Basically all cleaning chores were repeated each night.

Other than cleaning being required \ufb01ve nights\n  per week, the rest was pretty much up to the contractor. Discus-\n  sions with the cleaning contractor revealed that each of\ufb01ce was vac-\n  uumed, all work surfaces dusted, and trash containers emptied\n  nightly. Additional work was done nightly in restrooms and hall-\n  ways. Basically all cleaning chores were repeated each night.

To achieve this, design engineers work with\npurchasing, manufacturing, and marketing as a cross-departmental team\nin the areas of developing speci\ufb01cations, interchangeable parts, and part\nsubstitutions.

To achieve this, design engineers work with\npurchasing, manufacturing, and marketing as a cross-departmental team\nin the areas of developing speci\ufb01cations, interchangeable parts, and part\nsubstitutions. This bears similarity to value analysis in that a cross-\ndepartmental team works together to reduce cost and improve the prod-\nuct.

In many companies it appears\nthat value analysis programs have evolved into concurrent design pro-\ngrams.\n     There are several bene\ufb01ts to the concurrent design approach, in-\ncluding reduced cost of goods, nimble release of new product to market,\nand wares or merchandise more in touch with customer requirements."

A prudent plan of action is to begin\n  simple and then move to more sophisticated projects, choosing ones that\n  tie into strategic objectives. Value analysis study projects are usually\n  identi\ufb01ed by management insight or through the use of organization\n  diagnostics. For each project it is imperative that the speci\ufb01c objectives\n  and scope be clearly stated and understood. Although value analysis can\n  be applied to almost any area, typical projects include products, produc-\n  tion processes, and/or other information processes that have problems\n  such as:\n       \u2666  High cost\n       \u2666  Unsatis\ufb01ed needs\n       \u2666  Redundancy or unnecessary functions\n       \u2666  Repetitive problems (multiple bottlenecks)\n       \u2666  Waste (time, effort, money, material)\n       \u2666  Complexity of time or consumption\n    Step Eight: Select a team. Once the project is de\ufb01ned, select a team\nrepresenting the elements of expertise necessary to address the project. 604                                    PART 4  Components and Capabilities\nTeam members should be capable, respected, and able to obtain the sup-\nport of their departments; they should also have an unbiased viewpoint.\nChoose a teamleader fromthe group.\n  Step Nine: Collect data. Information for analysis should be collected,\nwith the value manager, the facilitator, and the team leader working\ntogether to identify what is required. The nature and extent of the data\ndepend on the project and the objectives, but they typically include facts\non cost, resources consumed, cycle times, suppliers, and any known\nproblems. Customer or \ufb01eld data may also be required. The team leader\nhas overall responsibility to see that the data is collected but may dele-\ngate the actual collection to various team members.\n       Step Ten: Conduct the workshop. The value manager and facilitator\nwork together on workshop preparation, making arrangements for items\nsuch as meeting facilities, equipment, and letters of invitation. The work-\nshop should be a full-time commitment during which the participants\nneed to focus their attention on the project without having their thoughts\ninterrupted by other commitments.\n     Step Eleven:        Implement approved projects.

Some regional purchasing man-\nager association surveys prefer to report their results as net difference\nindexes or net percentage rising (NPR). The NPR is simply the percentage\nof respondents reporting higher minus the percentage reporting lower.\nThe net difference, which is bounded by 1100 and 2100, is related to\nthe diffusion index as follows: NPR 5 2 3 (DI 2 50), where DI is the\ndiffusion index.

To effectively manage inventory is a challenge that\n  requires balancing the con\ufb02icting objectives of inventory management.\n  Some of these con\ufb02icting challenges in inventory management include:\n       1.  Never run out of anything. Marketing encourages high\n           inventories so that the product can be shipped to the\n           customers quickly. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t sell from an empty wagon.\u2019\u2019\u00b9\n       2.

Note in Box 26\u20131 that for every dollar the\ninventory is reduced, net income is also reduced by a dollar.\n     The bene\ufb01ts of reducing inventory must also be weighed against\nthe impact on customer service. Poor customer service can result in lost\nsales, a bad reputation, and falling market share. The perfect solution is\nto reduce the investment in inventory and increase customer service.

On the balance sheet, un-\nder the current assets section, inventories are usually broken down into\nraw materials, work in process, and \ufb01nished goods. 644                                   PART 4 Components and Capabilities\n   B O X      26\u20131\n   INCOME STATEMENT\n                                                      $10 less\n                                   Base              inventory\n   Sales                                 300                  300\n   Cost of goods sold\n     Material purchases       100                 100\n     Labor                     50                  50\n     Overhead                  40                  40\n   Change in inventory          0                  (10)\n   Total COGS                            190                  180\n   Gross pro\ufb01t fromsales                110                  120\n   Expenses                               50                   50\n   Net income                           $ 60                 $ 70\n       Inventory also appears in the company\u2019s income statement in-\ncluded in the cost of goods. If the investment in inventory is reduced,\nthe net income is increased. Note in Box 26\u20131 that for every dollar the\ninventory is reduced, net income is also reduced by a dollar.\n     The bene\ufb01ts of reducing inventory must also be weighed against\nthe impact on customer service. Poor customer service can result in lost\nsales, a bad reputation, and falling market share. The perfect solution is\nto reduce the investment in inventory and increase customer service. At\nthe end of this chapter we will discuss ten techniques that can reduce\ninventory and maintain or increase customer service.\nMARGINAL INVENTORY COSTS\nMany costs can be associated with inventory."

If lead times \ufb02uctuate, EOQ should not\n          be used.\n       Materials Requirements Planning (MRP)\nMRP is a computerized inventory management system that integrates\nthe scheduling and controlling of materials. Joseph Orlicky, Oliver Wight,\nand George Plossl are credited with developing MRP. The basic elements\nof MRP are:\n      1.  Master production schedule (MPS). The master production\n          schedule is the plan of what should be built by a production\n          plant. The MPS is developed frominput fromthe sales\n          forecast. MRP is only as good as the MPS.\n      2.  Inventory status. Another key ingredient of MRP is an accurate\n          record of the inventory. Inventory accuracy is essential to MRP.\n      3.  Bills of material. A bill of material is a structure of all the raw\n          materials, parts, subassemblies, and production operations that\n          are involved in producing an end item.

Joseph Orlicky, Oliver Wight,\nand George Plossl are credited with developing MRP. The basic elements\nof MRP are:\n      1.  Master production schedule (MPS). The master production\n          schedule is the plan of what should be built by a production\n          plant. The MPS is developed frominput fromthe sales\n          forecast. MRP is only as good as the MPS.\n      2.  Inventory status. Another key ingredient of MRP is an accurate\n          record of the inventory. Inventory accuracy is essential to MRP.\n      3.  Bills of material. A bill of material is a structure of all the raw\n          materials, parts, subassemblies, and production operations that\n          are involved in producing an end item. An accurate bill of\n          material is necessary to explode the MPS into its components.\n      4.  Component lead time. The lead time of every item in the bill of\n          materials must be known. The component lead time is offset\n          so the required parts are available when needed.\n      Figure 26\u20136 shows the essential elements of MRP.\u2078\n      Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP 2)\nThe shortcoming of MRP is that it is a closed-loop manufacturing system\nthat does not get feedback fromseveral key areas: capacity, shop \ufb02oor\n8.

You can\u2019t improve forecasts if you\n        don\u2019t measure them. Measure and track how accurate your\n        forecasts are.\n     \u2666  Use model switching programs. For high-volume parts, pick a\n        systemthat uses several forecasting m\n                                            odels (least square\n        versus Winters) and selects the forecast that gives the best\n        result.\n     \u2666  Allow for seasonal forecasting. Use a systemthat recognizes\n        seasonal patterns.\n     \u2666  Variable safety stocks. Pick a systemthat calculates a variable\n        safety stock per forecast period versus a systemthat uses the\n        same safety stock for each period. A variable safety stock\n        allows a smaller safety stock in low-forecast periods and\n        higher safety stocks in high-demand periods (see Figure 26\u20139).\n     \u2666  Forecast at the lowest level. Forecast to the lowest level in the\n        supply chain and pull the forecast up the chain.

You can\u2019t improve forecasts if you\n        don\u2019t measure them. Measure and track how accurate your\n        forecasts are.\n     \u2666  Use model switching programs. For high-volume parts, pick a\n        systemthat uses several forecasting m\n                                            odels (least square\n        versus Winters) and selects the forecast that gives the best\n        result.\n     \u2666  Allow for seasonal forecasting. Use a systemthat recognizes\n        seasonal patterns.\n     \u2666  Variable safety stocks. Pick a systemthat calculates a variable\n        safety stock per forecast period versus a systemthat uses the\n        same safety stock for each period. A variable safety stock\n        allows a smaller safety stock in low-forecast periods and\n        higher safety stocks in high-demand periods (see Figure 26\u20139).\n     \u2666  Forecast at the lowest level. Forecast to the lowest level in the\n        supply chain and pull the forecast up the chain.

If written com-\npany policy gives only the purchasing department express authority to\nenter into contracts with suppliers, but the accounts payable department\nroutinely pays invoices for supplies or services ordered by personnel\noutside of purchasing, it has effectively given these nonpurchasing per-\nsonnel apparent authority to make these purchases. This is the practice\ncommonly known as \u2018\u2018back-door procurement.\u2019\u2019\n     In a company with a highly centralized purchasing organization,\nlines of express or actual agency authority are usually well de\ufb01ned in\nwritten policies and are fairly well adhered to. In a decentralized setting,\nwritten policies are often less complete or current, and employees and\ntheir suppliers often rely to a greater extent on apparent authority. Reen-\ngineering the purchasing function, or introducing new technologies such\nas procurement cards or electronic contracting, often causes companies\nto reexamine and rede\ufb01ne their purchasing lines of authority, often re-\nwriting their policies and procedures. When they do so, they are invok-\ning the principles of agency law.\n     In summary, buyers must be concerned with two aspects of agency\nauthority:\n     1.  How can we run our company\u2019s procurement activities to\n         ensure that purchases are made only by individuals with\n         express purchasing authority, and so avoid, or at least reduce,\n         \u2018\u2018back-door procurement?\u2019\u2019 Up-to-date written policies spelling\n         out which job titles carry purchasing authority are best\n         because they establish actual or express authority. In addition\n         to formal policies, there needs to be a program of internal\n         education and communication so all company employees\n         know, and are periodically reminded about, what they can and\n         cannot commit to. Programs aimed at telling suppliers whom\n         they can and cannot deal with are also useful but should be a\n         second line of defense.\n     2.  When we negotiate with suppliers, how can we make sure the\n         agreements are enforceable?",

If written com-\npany policy gives only the purchasing department express authority to\nenter into contracts with suppliers, but the accounts payable department\nroutinely pays invoices for supplies or services ordered by personnel\noutside of purchasing, it has effectively given these nonpurchasing per-\nsonnel apparent authority to make these purchases. This is the practice\ncommonly known as \u2018\u2018back-door procurement.\u2019\u2019\n     In a company with a highly centralized purchasing organization,\nlines of express or actual agency authority are usually well de\ufb01ned in\nwritten policies and are fairly well adhered to. In a decentralized setting,\nwritten policies are often less complete or current, and employees and\ntheir suppliers often rely to a greater extent on apparent authority. Reen-\ngineering the purchasing function, or introducing new technologies such\nas procurement cards or electronic contracting, often causes companies\nto reexamine and rede\ufb01ne their purchasing lines of authority, often re-\nwriting their policies and procedures. When they do so, they are invok-\ning the principles of agency law.\n     In summary, buyers must be concerned with two aspects of agency\nauthority:\n     1.  How can we run our company\u2019s procurement activities to\n         ensure that purchases are made only by individuals with\n         express purchasing authority, and so avoid, or at least reduce,\n         \u2018\u2018back-door procurement?\u2019\u2019 Up-to-date written policies spelling\n         out which job titles carry purchasing authority are best\n         because they establish actual or express authority. In addition\n         to formal policies, there needs to be a program of internal\n         education and communication so all company employees\n         know, and are periodically reminded about, what they can and\n         cannot commit to. Programs aimed at telling suppliers whom\n         they can and cannot deal with are also useful but should be a\n         second line of defense.\n     2.

The most notable example is the Uniform Commercial Code, or\nUCC. It is the product of extensive work, over several decades, by the\nNational  Conference  of  Commissioners    on  Uniform    State   Laws\n(NCCUSL) working together with the American Law Institute (ALI). By\nthe late 1950s a version had been developed that eventually saw wide-\nspread adoption by the states.\n Article 2 of the UCC applies to the sale of goods, which until fairly\nrecent times was the dominant context of interstate trade. In making\ndecisions in cases involving the sale of goods, courts look \ufb01rst to the\nwritten rules of the UCC as adopted in the state whose law applies to\nthat contract, and then to case law when the UCC rules require inter-\npretation or do not answer the speci\ufb01c question at hand. The UCC does\nnot apply to contracts for services, which until recently tended to be\nmuch more local in nature. Courts look to case law to resolve disputes\nin this area, although they may apply UCC rules by analogy to contracts\nfor services. Where a contract is for a sale of both goods and services,\ncourts make a determination as to which\u2014the goods or the services\u2014is\npredominant. If the contract is predominantly for the sale of goods, then\nthe UCC will be applied. The common law will be applied where services\ncomprise the predominant part of the contract.",

                "text": "CONTRACT LAW\nMost of the day-to-day activities of purchasers involve the law of con-\ntracts. Every purchase is a contract between the buyer and the supplier,\ngoverned by the principles of contract law. Like agency law, contract law\noriginated in the common law of England. It is a body of law that is\nleft to the states, not the federal government, to address. Generally CHAPTER 27  Legal Aspects of Purchasing                            671\nspeaking, the law of the state where the contract is formed and per-\nformed will apply to that contract, but the growth of interstate and global\ncommerce has meant that the law of contracts has been shaped to a very\nlarge degree by a process of developing uniformstatutes that are de-\nsigned to codify common law principles in a consistent manner from\nstate to state within the United States and even across national bound-\naries. The most notable example is the Uniform Commercial Code, or\nUCC. It is the product of extensive work, over several decades, by the\nNational  Conference  of  Commissioners    on  Uniform    State   Laws\n(NCCUSL) working together with the American Law Institute (ALI). By\nthe late 1950s a version had been developed that eventually saw wide-\nspread adoption by the states.\n Article 2 of the UCC applies to the sale of goods, which until fairly\nrecent times was the dominant context of interstate trade. In making\ndecisions in cases involving the sale of goods, courts look \ufb01rst to the\nwritten rules of the UCC as adopted in the state whose law applies to\nthat contract, and then to case law when the UCC rules require inter-\npretation or do not answer the speci\ufb01c question at hand. The UCC does\nnot apply to contracts for services, which until recently tended to be\nmuch more local in nature. Courts look to case law to resolve disputes\nin this area, although they may apply UCC rules by analogy to contracts\nfor services. Where a contract is for a sale of both goods and services,\ncourts make a determination as to which\u2014the goods or the services\u2014is\npredominant. If the contract is predominantly for the sale of goods, then\nthe UCC will be applied. The common law will be applied where services\ncomprise the predominant part of the contract."

Agreement. In order to enter into an agreement, the parties\n          must \u2018\u2018mutually assent\u2019\u2019 to the same terms. This is often\n          referred to as reaching a \u2018\u2018meeting of the minds.\u2019\u2019 Mutual\n          assent is typically manifested through the process of offer and\n          acceptance, in which one of the parties makes an offer to enter\n          into a contract and the other party accepts that offer, thereby\n          creating a contract (if the other essential elements of a valid\n          contract are present). Offer and acceptance are discussed in\n          greater detail below.\n      2.  Competent parties. In order for a contract to be enforceable, it\n          must have been made between parties with both the legal\n          capacity and the authority to forma valid contract.\n          Incompetency (i.e., lack of such legal capacity) arises where, at\n          the time of entering into the contract, one of the parties: (1) is\n          a minor, (2) suffers from some mental in\ufb01rmity, or (3) is under\n          the in\ufb02uence of drugs or alcohol. In many states, majority (i.e.,\n          the time when one is no longer a minor) is reached at age 18,\n          but in some it is reached at age 21. Most contracts involving\n          incompetents are voidable at the incompetent\u2019s option, which\n          means that the incompetent has the choice of either enforcing\n          the contract or acting as if no contract had ever been made.\n          Both parties to a sales contract must also have the necessary\n          authority to contract (see the previous discussion of agency).\n          All competent individuals have the authority to contract for\n          themselves.",

But before making any order, the court will\nexamine whether there is a valid contract to enforce.\n                  The Essentials of a Valid Contract\nFour essentials must be present to create a valid and enforceable contract:\n(1) agreement, (2) made by competent parties, (3) concerning legal subject\nmatter, and (4) supported by mutual consideration. 674                                      PART 4  Components and Capabilities\n      1.  Agreement. In order to enter into an agreement, the parties\n          must \u2018\u2018mutually assent\u2019\u2019 to the same terms. This is often\n          referred to as reaching a \u2018\u2018meeting of the minds.\u2019\u2019 Mutual\n          assent is typically manifested through the process of offer and\n          acceptance, in which one of the parties makes an offer to enter\n          into a contract and the other party accepts that offer, thereby\n          creating a contract (if the other essential elements of a valid\n          contract are present). Offer and acceptance are discussed in\n          greater detail below.\n      2.  Competent parties. In order for a contract to be enforceable, it\n          must have been made between parties with both the legal\n          capacity and the authority to forma valid contract.\n          Incompetency (i.e., lack of such legal capacity) arises where, at\n          the time of entering into the contract, one of the parties: (1) is\n          a minor, (2) suffers from some mental in\ufb01rmity, or (3) is under\n          the in\ufb02uence of drugs or alcohol. In many states, majority (i.e.,\n          the time when one is no longer a minor) is reached at age 18,\n          but in some it is reached at age 21. Most contracts involving\n          incompetents are voidable at the incompetent\u2019s option, which\n          means that the incompetent has the choice of either enforcing\n          the contract or acting as if no contract had ever been made.\n          Both parties to a sales contract must also have the necessary\n          authority to contract (see the previous discussion of agency).\n          All competent individuals have the authority to contract for\n          themselves."

The clause\nshould also specify the base index that will best re\ufb02ect price changes in\nthe commodities involved in the supplier\u2019s product. And, \ufb01nally, the\nadjustment should be applied to a predetermined percentage of the total\nprice, such percentage re\ufb02ecting the ratio of the amount of the critical\nraw material included in the supplier\u2019s product to the total cost of the\nproduct.\n                                Payment\nSection 2-310(1) provides that unless otherwise agreed, \u2018\u2018payment is due\nat the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goods.\u2019\u2019 Note\nthat the purchaser\u2019s payment obligation is tied to its receipt of the goods,\neven if the agreement provides for delivery F.O.B. place of shipment.\nThis means that although the supplier will have completed its perform-\nance obligation when it delivered the goods into the hands of the com-\nmon carrier, the purchaser is not obligated to perform (i.e., pay for the CHAPTER 27  Legal Aspects of Purchasing                             687\ngoods) until a later time. Section 2-511 further provides that tender of\npayment by the purchaser is a condition to the supplier\u2019s duty to tender\nand complete delivery. Section 2-507 makes tender of delivery of the\ngoods a condition to the purchaser\u2019s duty to pay for them. These two\nsections operate to render the duty to deliver and the duty to pay con-\ncurrent conditions. The end result of all of this is that the default pay-\nment rule under the UCC is cash on delivery. Purchasers typically ne-\ngotiate for credit terms at the time of contracting with the supplier. This\nincludes a credit period after receipt of the goods and possibly a cash\ndiscount for prompt payment of the invoice within a speci\ufb01ed number\nof days after the material has been received.

For example, if a contractor installed a different manufacturer\u2019s pipe\nthan was called for in the contract, but it was of the same grade as the\npipe speci\ufb01ed, the contractor will have substantially performed because\nthe deviation, while intentional, was trivial.

Incom\n                                                                    -\nplete or damaged records will lead to adverse \ufb01ndings against the party\nthat should have kept the records.\n      Following the principles described elsewhere in this chapter, the\nadjudicator will decide whether there was a valid contract; if so, what\nwere its terms and what exactly do they mean; whether on the facts\npresented there has been a breach, and if so, what the remedy should\nbe\u2014to order performance or to provide for payment of damages, and in\nwhat amount. By having a clear understanding of their rights and obli-\ngations under the UCC, common law, and other statutes, buyers and\nsellers can develop contract documents and contract administration pro-\ntocols that make disputes, if not easy, then at least easier, to resolve.\n    After considering the evidence on all these questions, the court or\narbitrator will make a formal decision, usually with \ufb01ndings of fact and\nconclusions of law, and will issue a formal judgment stating the sub-\nstance of the remedy. Parties can appeal court decisions and some arbi-\ntration rulings to higher courts, and still more time may elapse before\nthe case results in a \ufb01nal judgment. The winning party must then invoke\nyet another judicial mechanism to enforce and collect on the judgement.\nREGULATIONS AFFECTING PURCHASERS\nThe old expression \u2018\u2018there oughtta be a law\u2019\u2019 captures the idea that for\nevery wrong, there must be a remedy, and the remedy might well be a\nstatute. Over the years, American lawmakers have responded to a great\nvariety of problems with detailed laws spelling out what people and\norganizations must do to correct the problem, with paperwork require-\nments to ensure compliance, and with penalties for not complying. The\n\u2018\u2018granddaddy of themall\u2019\u2019 for purchasers is the body of antitrust laws,\nresponding to the great monopolies of the early Industrial Revolution\nand establishing the principles of free and fair competition that are at\nthe heart of American domestic commerce."

What   seems  to be\nhappening today is similar to what has happened over the centuries:\nbusinesspeople make business decisions based on practicality and com-\nmon sense, sometimes taking risks in order to make money; and courts,\nlegislatures, and uniform laws commissions look to the fundamental\nprinciples of the old laws and try to make them work in the new settings.\n     A few examples illustrate some of the major issues.\n    Under common law and the UCC, to be enforceable in court, certain\ncontracts must be evidenced by a writing signed by the party (or the\nparty\u2019s authorized agent) against whomenforcem\n                                               ent is being sought.\nThis requirement protects against fraud and mistake. In today\u2019s digital\nworld, the requirement for a \u2018\u2018writing\u2019\u2019 is being replaced by a require-\nment for a \u2018\u2018record\u2019\u2019 (which could be entirely electronic), and the signa-\nture requirement is being met by elaborate \u2018\u2018authentication\u2019\u2019 mechanisms\nto ensure that the parties to the electronic transaction actually are who\nthey appear to be and that the \u2018\u2018record\u2019\u2019 of the transaction has not been\ntampered with during transmittal."

These are:\n     1.  Lump sum contract. Scope of work is de\ufb01ned by IR or others,\n         including what will or will not be retained by owner. The\n         contractor keeps all property not identi\ufb01ed by owner as razed\n         property and submits a \ufb01xed price for the performance of the\n         work. In this instance either the owner pays the contractor or\n         the contractor pays the owner. Normally, lump sum is the best\n         way to contract for the work.\n     2.  Cost plus a \ufb01xed fee contract. Typically used when either the\n         scope of work cannot be clearly de\ufb01ned and/or the owner\n         retains all the scrap equipment and materials to be sold. All\n         costs of the work are borne by the owner, plus a percentage\n         fee above the cost is added as contractor pro\ufb01t. This is a good\n         method when the work is not clearly de\ufb01ned and many\n         changes in the work are expected.\n     3.  Time and materials contract. Used as in 2, but in this case the\n         contractor adds a pro\ufb01t and overhead percentage to the actual\n         hourly labor rates. Owner pays rental costs on the required\n         equipment and also a percentage markup on materials and\n         supplies. T&M contracts are an excellent contract method for\n         small-dollar demolitions (under $200M), and also when the\n         scope is not well de\ufb01ned or when time is of the essence.\n         Typically, an annual agreement is developed for this type of\n         work with one or two contractors.\n     If IR is responsible for demolition contracting, an \u2018\u2018approved\u2019\u2019 con-\ntractors\u2019 list should be developed and maintained.",

                "text": "In all cases and whenever possible, individuals familiar with the\n   facility should be retained until the demolition is complete. Their knowl-\n     edge is invaluable not only to the contractor, but also to the owner, to\n        ensure that the work is done in accordance with the contract and that CHAPTER 28  Investment Recovery                                    727\nall safety and/or work issues can be answered so as not to create undue\nsafety hazards or delays for the contractor.\n     Contracting for demolition/dismantlement is typically done using\none or a combination of three types of contracts. These are:\n     1.  Lump sum contract. Scope of work is de\ufb01ned by IR or others,\n         including what will or will not be retained by owner. The\n         contractor keeps all property not identi\ufb01ed by owner as razed\n         property and submits a \ufb01xed price for the performance of the\n         work. In this instance either the owner pays the contractor or\n         the contractor pays the owner. Normally, lump sum is the best\n         way to contract for the work.\n     2.  Cost plus a \ufb01xed fee contract. Typically used when either the\n         scope of work cannot be clearly de\ufb01ned and/or the owner\n         retains all the scrap equipment and materials to be sold. All\n         costs of the work are borne by the owner, plus a percentage\n         fee above the cost is added as contractor pro\ufb01t. This is a good\n         method when the work is not clearly de\ufb01ned and many\n         changes in the work are expected.\n     3.  Time and materials contract. Used as in 2, but in this case the\n         contractor adds a pro\ufb01t and overhead percentage to the actual\n         hourly labor rates. Owner pays rental costs on the required\n         equipment and also a percentage markup on materials and\n         supplies. T&M contracts are an excellent contract method for\n         small-dollar demolitions (under $200M), and also when the\n         scope is not well de\ufb01ned or when time is of the essence.\n         Typically, an annual agreement is developed for this type of\n         work with one or two contractors.\n     If IR is responsible for demolition contracting, an \u2018\u2018approved\u2019\u2019 con-\ntractors\u2019 list should be developed and maintained."

Ei-\nther the cost of cleaning themup or separating themis too high or, in\nsome cases, the technology is not yet available. If it is not possible to use\nthe material as is, disposal will have to be considered.\n      If the inherent energy content of such material is signi\ufb01cant, the\nmaterial may be a candidate for energy recovery.

If a mixed\nmaterial is needed to give the product its unique properties to win in\nthe marketplace, so be it.

The importance of estab-\nlishing appropriate assumptions lies in the rational process of identifying\nand recognizing how these factors in\ufb02uence management decisions.\n         The budget format for each part or level within the organization\nshould readily identify \ufb01nancial and performance variances throughout\nthe year and provide information on the potential bene\ufb01ts and conse-\nquences of management actions. This format should emphasize cash \ufb02ow\ninstead of revenue or sales, focus on total costs instead of burdens and\nratios, and relate outputs to activities and actions. Of course, the best\nformat for any organization depends on the speci\ufb01c purpose of that or-\nganization.\n          Budgetary content should furnish the most likely numerical pre-\ndictions of next year\u2019s revenue/sales and expenditures. Because the\nbudget addresses the future, the numbers that represent expected per-\nformance are estimates. Managers should ensure these numbers are the\nmost probable and meaningful estimates possible. Good content, based\non direct data, trends, or models, requires the proper planning for and\na clear understanding of the organization\u2019s expected output. Direct data\nand trends must be time-sensitive because service or product demand is\nnot constant and conditions causing the trend will change. Models are CHAPTER 29   Managing Budgets and Operations                         749\napproximations, but they are a better source of predictions than inaccu-\nrate direct data or trends, particularly for organizations that can bene\ufb01t\nfromstatistical and probability analyses."

Poor planning and estimating, errors in reporting, uncontrol-\nlable factors, and certain management decisions may cause variances.\nManagers should pay special attention to variances for which the un-\nderlying causes are not known. Since variances are interrelated, their net\neffect should be considered. For example, the production department\nmay show a favorable variance indicating lower unit cost of producing\na particular item. Conversely, the inventory department may experience\nan unfavorable variance resulting fromthe higher cost of holding excess\ninventory of this itemunless it is already sold.\n Division, department, or unit budgets, especially those sections per-\ntaining to the acquisition of goods and services, affect the purchasing\ndepartment. In the conduct of its activities, purchasing usually is re-\nsponsible for closely monitoring these budgets to ensure compliance with\nbudgetary limits for securing goods and services for the organization. If\nthe procurement of a good or service exceeds the limit for the speci\ufb01c\nbudget cost category, the purchasing department should contact the di-\nvision, department, or unit to secure the proper authorization to either\nignore the limit or modify the budget, as required. Depending on the\npolicies, procedures, or practices of the organization, purchasing may be\nempowered to make the necessary adjustments to individual budgets.\nPURCHASING DEPARTMENT BUDGET\nLike other parts or levels of the organization, the purchasing department\nproduces a budget.

To the extent that it includes these cost\ncategories, the purchasing department\u2019s budget is interdependent with\nthe other parts or levels of the organization.

All too often marketing is seen as a thoughtful\nadvertising, promotion, or communication strategy designed to have ba-\nsically a public relations-oriented focus. This is a limited view. A more\ncomprehensive view is that of marketing as the \u2018\u2018process of planning and\nexecuting the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas,\ngoods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and or-\nganizational goals.\u2019\u2019\u00b2 Marketing is an integrated process of creating and\nfacilitating exchange concerning tangibles and intangibles (ideas). In a\nbasic way, marketing is a philosophy, a call to organizational action, a\nway of thinking, and a perspective on managing various exchange pro-\ncesses. It is not one action or a series of disjointed actions, but a cohesive,\n2.",

All too often marketing is seen as a thoughtful\nadvertising, promotion, or communication strategy designed to have ba-\nsically a public relations-oriented focus. This is a limited view. A more\ncomprehensive view is that of marketing as the \u2018\u2018process of planning and\nexecuting the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas,\ngoods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and or-\nganizational goals.\u2019\u2019\u00b2 Marketing is an integrated process of creating and\nfacilitating exchange concerning tangibles and intangibles (ideas). In a\nbasic way, marketing is a philosophy, a call to organizational action, a\nway of thinking, and a perspective on managing various exchange pro-\ncesses. It is not one action or a series of disjointed actions, but a cohesive,\n2."

Each\nelement has a pivotal role to play in marketing success. Frequently the\npromotion element is elevated in importance above the other compo-\nnents. But to pursue that logic is shortsighted and myopic. Sustained\nsuccess in marketing is derived from a careful blending and mixing\nof elements to match challenges and opportunities associated with ex-\nchange processes.\nEXECUTION OF MARKETING STRATEGIES\nFOR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT SUCCESS\nConceptualizing marketing strategies for supply management is an im-\nportant step. However, equally critical is the appropriate execution of\nstrategy to reach internal and external partners. The best plans with poor\nimplementation fail to reach the mark. To ensure some modicum of suc-\ncess, an action plan is required. Very simply, this involves asking, relative\nto the marketing plan: Who? What? When? Where? How?"

The key threats might include injuring current relation-\nships among the two target groups, the remote possibility that supply\nmanagement might be promising more than it can realistically deliver\n(and the corresponding effect on credibility), and the general uncertainty\nassociated with new and bold initiatives in tradition-laden healthcare\norganizations.\n                    Marketing Objectives and Goals\nWhat are the speci\ufb01c goals of the marketing effort in both quantitative\nand qualitative terms?

When variance to\nstandard is also a measure of purchasing performance, political games\noften result. What de\ufb01nes success? If ending the year with favorable\nvariances is de\ufb01ned as success, purchasing has an incentive to set high\nstandards. Actual prices less than standard cost can then be easily\nachieved, and purchasing is successful. If both favorable and unfavorable\nvariances are bad, and achieving the standard is the only success, then\nhitting the number at any cost will be the resulting behavior\u2014even if\nthat means walking away from a cost-saving opportunity or exerting\ndestructive pressure on suppliers.\n     Using standard costs as a measure of purchasing\u2019s or a supplier\u2019s\nperformance does not work very well even in the most enlightened en-\nvironments.

                "text": "Data integrity can become a major issue. Dates kept current will\nincrease the supplier\u2019s acceptance of their calculated delivery perform-\nance. A shipment (expedited by purchasing) delivered before its original\ndue date (as requested) will be recorded as early (and possibly subject\nto refusal or return) if the original due date is not changed in the pur-\nchaser\u2019s system. The supplier will be penalized in delivery performance\nfor doing what was requested. If due dates are not well maintained, the\nperformance measurement rapidly loses credibility with suppliers, and\nif bad data are used against them, relationship damage may result. (A\nsecond area to monitor for data integrity is receiving. A backlog on the\ndocks can also create inaccurate delivery data.)\n       What is the appropriate due date against which delivery will be\nmeasured? Some use the suppliers\u2019 promised delivery dates, while others\nuse the requester\u2019s need dates. Using the supplier\u2019s promise date in-\ncreases the likelihood that the date will be met (increasing delivery pre-\ndictability), but the buying organization\u2019s needs may not be served. Need\ndates may change as schedules change, but using them provides a more\naccurate re\ufb02ection of supplier \ufb02exibility in meeting actual customer de-\nmands.\n       The next de\ufb01nition required to establish a delivery performance\nmeasurement is what constitutes \u2018\u2018on-time.\u2019\u2019 What window of time is\nappropriate for your organization? For organizations with many deliv-\neries and tightly scheduled unloading docks, on-time may be a 30-minute\nperiod during which this supplier\u2019s truck is scheduled to unload. Other\nexamples include the due date plus or minus nothing, the due date plus\nor minus one day, up to \ufb01ve days early but no days late, within the\nweek, etc."
