A change of sub-suppliers\n           may void previous testing releases, thus requiring additional vehicle validation testing by MBC.

The three-stage supplier cooperation model Q-H:ELP is a\n            method that supports the achievement of these requirements for Suppliers.\n            With regard to the treatment of quality and logistics issues, this interdisciplinary procedure not only\n            enables rapid action, but in particular binding and effective process optimization for all parties involved.\n            Q-H:ELP ensures that the various Mercedes-Benz Cars (MBC) plant apply a uniform procedure and that\n            the Suppliers from all production plants are integrated into the issue solving process via the same\n            procedure in order to improve cooperation and delivery performance.\n            In this way, Q-H:ELP sets a binding standards in troubleshooting \u2013 standards that are just as important\n            for Suppliers as they are for the entire MBC organization. Consistently positive and quality and logistics\n            services of a Supplier are taken into account accordingly with regard to new product projects.\n            Suppliers who practice the zero defect target and practice an exemplary issue solving and\n            prevention do not come in Q-H:ELP.

Parts and products usually have to\nbe stored, which requires skills in Warehouse Management (Chapter 13). As suppliers are independent\nbusiness entities, Supply Chain Management (Chapter 14), seen from a manufacturer\u2019s perspective,\nencompasses the design and analysis of a supply chain, techniques to reduce or eliminate the wild swings\nknown as the \u201cbullwhip effect,\u201d and supplier development.\nPart 5, Enhancing Performance is about what manufacturers should do once the concepts and methods\nfrom Parts 1 to 4 are roughly established. The flows of information and materials and the work of peo-\nple should be continuously improved to enhance the sustainable competitiveness of a manufacturing\ncompany. This, in turn, begs the question of defining relevant, understandable, and actionable perfor-\nmance metrics and using them in a way that avoids counterproductive gaming. This is Managing Perfor-\nmance (Chapter 15), which must be done both during normal operations and emergencies. The\nexperience of the past decades in Japan and elsewhere has yielded a number of approaches to the plan-\nning and management of improvement activities of varying scopes and durations, which constitute a\nbody of knowledge on Improving Performance (Chapter 16).

                "text": "We discuss the impact of Operational Technology\n(OT) and Information Technology (IT) (Chapter 8), from what happens inside production machines to\nhigh-level support, and then go deeper into the specific issues related to Planning and Control (Chapter\n9) and Master Data Management (Chapter 10).\n                                                                                                    xv In Part 4, Making Materials Flow, we start with Internal Logistics (Chapter 11) \u2013 the work inside the fac-\ntory walls \u2013 and move on to External Logistics (Chapter 12) \u2013 which happens outside and involves col-\nlaboration with suppliers and possibly third-party logistics services. Parts and products usually have to\nbe stored, which requires skills in Warehouse Management (Chapter 13). As suppliers are independent\nbusiness entities, Supply Chain Management (Chapter 14), seen from a manufacturer\u2019s perspective,\nencompasses the design and analysis of a supply chain, techniques to reduce or eliminate the wild swings\nknown as the \u201cbullwhip effect,\u201d and supplier development.\nPart 5, Enhancing Performance is about what manufacturers should do once the concepts and methods\nfrom Parts 1 to 4 are roughly established. The flows of information and materials and the work of peo-\nple should be continuously improved to enhance the sustainable competitiveness of a manufacturing\ncompany. This, in turn, begs the question of defining relevant, understandable, and actionable perfor-\nmance metrics and using them in a way that avoids counterproductive gaming. This is Managing Perfor-\nmance (Chapter 15), which must be done both during normal operations and emergencies. The\nexperience of the past decades in Japan and elsewhere has yielded a number of approaches to the plan-\nning and management of improvement activities of varying scopes and durations, which constitute a\nbody of knowledge on Improving Performance (Chapter 16). It suggests that Improving Quality (Chapter\n17) should receive special attention, which it does in this book. Finally, besides programming machines,\nmaintaining them is the other task that will ultimately remain for people.

Production work can be\ntedious, but workers still experience pride in workmanship, particularly when the products have a repu-\ntation for high quality. In addition, the factory is a place of intense teamwork that fosters a camaraderie\namong coworkers that is uncommon in other workplaces. The work of designing and operating factories\nrequires a combination of technical and managerial skills that is best grounded in a fascination with how\nthings are made.

The\n        challenge is to ensure that the right materials are available at the right time in the right quantities.\n        The materials must also be delivered at the right locations inside the factory and be presented for\n        easy picking by operators or loading into machines.\n    \u2022   ECONOMICS: A factory must provide economic value to the company, but that can take many\n        forms. The most straightforward motive is to profit from the sales of the goods but it is by no\n        means the only one. Sometimes, the company prefers to make components in-house, even if it is\n        more expensive than outsourcing, in order to have exclusive access to the plant\u2019s capacity and pre-\n        vent know-how from leaking to competitors. Other companies set up a factory in the heart of an\n        industry concentration, where they can grow their know-how by tapping into the local talent\n        pool. Moreover, in a given factory, the objectives for generating economic returns change over\n        time."

Operators\n      Although the operators populate the most important job in manufacturing, the gap between operators\n      and management is marked in a variety of ways. For example, depending on industry and geographic\n      location, it is not uncommon that different employee categories wear different work clothing. For\n      example, shop floor employees can wear blue, the team leader perhaps light blue or gray, area manage-\n      ment white, and technicians red. Higher-level managers and office workers usually wear their own\n                                                                                                          17 Getting to Know Manufacturing\nclothing. This choice is partly due to the need for different clothing in different jobs. In factories that\nrequire high levels of cleanliness, like the semiconductor industry, fine electronics, pharmaceutical\nindustries or food processing, it is usual to wear white coveralls.

Operators\n      Although the operators populate the most important job in manufacturing, the gap between operators\n      and management is marked in a variety of ways. For example, depending on industry and geographic\n      location, it is not uncommon that different employee categories wear different work clothing. For\n      example, shop floor employees can wear blue, the team leader perhaps light blue or gray, area manage-\n      ment white, and technicians red.

This choice is partly due to the need for different clothing in different jobs. In factories that\nrequire high levels of cleanliness, like the semiconductor industry, fine electronics, pharmaceutical\nindustries or food processing, it is usual to wear white coveralls.

This means having a\n  deep expertise in one functional area (e.g., Engineering, Purchasing, or Sales), and a broad\n  expertise in at least two other functional areas.\n  The people in support roles should render services production needs for today or tomorrow.\n  Most companies staf departments with specialists who have not necessarily worked in pro-\n  duction. It is in fact common for people to move from one support department in one com-\n  pany to the same department in another (e.g., Engineering, Accounting, or Logistics),\n  allowing individuals to spend their entire careers in the same support function.\n  While this is expected to result in a higher level of specialized expertise, it does not pro-\n  mote mutual understanding and cooperation across departments. Among the many possible\n  countermeasures is the systematic rotation of some employees between departments every\n  few years. It is common in Japan. The person you encounter in Production Control may have\n  been a Design Engineer for 5 years and, as a result, understands engineering issues. Work-\n  ing in the Quality department does not have to be a lifetime commitment. You can come\n  from Production, spend a few years in Quality, and go on to Maintenance. People who\n  rotate in this fashion may have less depth in specialized knowledge but more on how the\n  organization works.",

If we don\u2019t use their time effectively, we are wasting their lives.\u201d\nTaking this perspective is not philanthropy. Specialists can improve one operation out of hundreds per-\nformed in a factory. Attending to the required level of detail on all operations is beyond the capacity of\nany reasonably sized engineering department. The design of operator jobs for the whole factory can only\nbe done by engaging the line organization, from the operators who do the jobs to their first-line managers.\n                      Figure 1.11  Operators are the most important people in manufacturing\n4  Franklin, B., Franklin, W. T., & Duane, W. (1834). Memoirs of Benjamin Franklin. M\u2019Carty & Davis.\n                                                                                                         19 Getting to Know Manufacturing\n  Box 1.4\n            Building T-type specialists in support roles through job-rotation\n  Some companies intentionally develop T-type specialists and leaders. This means having a\n  deep expertise in one functional area (e.g., Engineering, Purchasing, or Sales), and a broad\n  expertise in at least two other functional areas.\n  The people in support roles should render services production needs for today or tomorrow.\n  Most companies staf departments with specialists who have not necessarily worked in pro-\n  duction. It is in fact common for people to move from one support department in one com-\n  pany to the same department in another (e.g., Engineering, Accounting, or Logistics),\n  allowing individuals to spend their entire careers in the same support function.\n  While this is expected to result in a higher level of specialized expertise, it does not pro-\n  mote mutual understanding and cooperation across departments. Among the many possible\n  countermeasures is the systematic rotation of some employees between departments every\n  few years. It is common in Japan. The person you encounter in Production Control may have\n  been a Design Engineer for 5 years and, as a result, understands engineering issues. Work-\n  ing in the Quality department does not have to be a lifetime commitment. You can come\n  from Production, spend a few years in Quality, and go on to Maintenance. People who\n  rotate in this fashion may have less depth in specialized knowledge but more on how the\n  organization works."

Arkwright also introduced a new manufacturing management practices that is still valid:\nPeople were employed instead of contracted and the working day was determined by the clock rather\nthan daylight hours.\nNote that concurrent developments in the systems of transportation, communication technology, and\nbanking were also central factors that enabled industrialization to take place. For example, James Watt\nperfected the steam engine and made use of one in a cotton mill in 1785, and, by that, the replacement\nof human, animal, and water power was complete."

In 1807, the French government terminated this program\nfor social rather than technical reasons.

A decade later, gunsmith Honor\u00e9 Blanc took up the challenge of making\nmuskets with interchangeable parts. In 1785, he demonstrated his results to American ambassador\nThomas Jefferson. Later, as US president, Jefferson launched the development effort that was eventually\nsuccessful.\nIn the 2020s, sensors can capture just about every parameter imaginable. In the late 1700s, on the other\nhand, thermometers to measure the appropriate temperature for forging iron had yet to be invented,\nand instructions called for the metal to be \u201ccherry red.\u201d In such a context, interchangeable parts were an\nalmost insurmountable technical challenge. In 1807, the French government terminated this program\nfor social rather than technical reasons. The gunsmiths of Saint-Etienne, France, had learned to forge a\nmusket barrel from a slab of iron with hand tools. To preserve their positions, they organized to prevent\nthe implementation of Blanc\u2019s system of proto-machine tools."

A sustainable management structure was not put in place until his\n        grandson, Henry Ford II, took over after World War II and brought in a group of executives who\n        came to be known as \u201cthe Whiz Kids.\u201d Best known among the Whiz Kids is Robert McNamara,\n        Ford President in 1960, U.S. Secretary of Defense for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and Presi-\n        dent of the World Bank.\nAs implemented, mass production decoupled assembly from sub-assembly production through inven-\ntory. High-volume, dedicated lines are still used today for products with sufficient demand. Unlike\nmass production lines, they are synchronized with feeder lines and the supply chain to avoid the accu-\nmulation of work-in-process (WIP).\nAlfred P. Sloan,\u00b9\u00b9 who led General Motors to surpass Ford and any other company in the world by the\n1930s, added another idea to the mass production system.

The above take on information is consistent with mathemati-\n   cian Claude Shannon\u2019s, to whom it is, more formally, the reduction in randomness due to\n   reading data. For example, before a fnal test in an assembly line, you thought a product\n   unit had a 99% probability of being ft for use and passing the fnal test increases this prob-\n   ability to 99.9999%. If the information is right, you have knowledge about the product\n   state. At the highest abstraction level, wisdom is the ability to use accumulated knowledge\n   to make decisions."

According to World Bank data, manufacturing typically accounts for around 10\u201325%\nof a country\u2019s GDP. For most countries, this ratio has been reasonably stable in recent decades (see Fig-\nure 1.23).

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis-\n        company Faber Castell is ofshored            tics (2018),\u00b9\u2078 manufacturing employment was 15.4 mil-\n                                                     lion in 1960 and 12.4 million in 2016. The most\ndramatic reduction happened in the first decade of the 21\u02e2\u1d57 century, when manufacturing employment\nfell from 17.2 million employees in 2000 to 11.5 million employees in 2010. Since 2010, manufacturing\nemployment has been steadily growing in absolute numbers in the US. Its relative share of direct jobs\nhowever is just 8.6% in 2016.\nAs relative employment continues to decline in manufacturing, a challenge in advanced economies is to\nmanage the gradual transition away from manufacturing jobs for most of the population, and the evolu-\ntion of manufacturing jobs towards higher levels of skills and education. For example, instead of con-\ntrolling one machine on the manufacturing floor, an employee writes the programs that run three\nmachines automatically. At the company level, managing this transition well is a matter of human-\nresource policies for competence development.\n18  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018).

If the Head of Department has an interest in the\nmatter to be discussed, the disclosure shall be made to the Director HR/ Admin &\nFinance.\nMany situations will require nothing more than a declaration of the interest\nand/or activity and subsequent authorisation by the Head of Department.

An approval to this effect must be obtained for a definite\nperiod of time, after which the approval shall again be sought from MD.\nThis period shall be determined from the date of joining of an incumbent in any\ngrade in that position but must not include a period of leave without pay.\n10.6 Types of Rotation / Transfer\nTransfer / rotation may take any of the following two forms:\nKHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY (KPPRA)   Page 62 10.6.1       Intradepartmental Rotation\nThe first Line Manager of the employee may rotate an employee within his/her\ndepartment with / without the employee\u2019s consent, but must intimate the\nemployee in advance. Such job rotation shall be effected in line with the general\ncareer plan of the employee in each category. Job rotation may also involve more\nthan one employee where interchange of assignments is to be made.\n10.6.2       Interdepartmental / Unit / Office/Region Transfers\nAny transfer of an employee entirely into a new set up shall be executed strictly\nin accordance to the guidelines mentioned herein. All such transfers shall be\nagainst pre-approved positions that are unoccupied due to any reason (new\nposition, resignation/transfer/dismissal/death of the previous incumbent etc.).\nThe transfers may be voluntary or involuntary."

Make sure that you use\nthe correct type of fire extinguisher. The wrong choice can turn a minor incident\ninto a major event. Always remember to take a position between the fire and the\nexit so that your escape route cannot be cut off. Be aware of what is happening in\nthe surrounding area and take account of your own limitations."
